<p>The universal commendation bestowed upon the exquisite
little story of "<span class="smcap">Violet</span>," published last year, has led to

of style, the same sympathy with nature, the same love
of the good and the true, which characterized its predecessor.

into contact with a mind of perfect purity, strong in
correct principles, loving and liberal in nature, and refined
in tastes and sympathies, the publishers commend this
little volume.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>
<h4>THE OLD FAIRY.</h4>

<p>There was a great forest, once, where you
might walk for miles, and never hear a sound
except the tapping of woodpeckers, the hooting
of owls, or the low bark of wolves, or the
strokes of a woodman's axe.</p>

<p>For on the borders of this wild, solitary place
one man had built his little house, and lived
there. It was very near the trees which he
spent his time in cutting down; and Peter
thought this all he cared about.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>
<p>But when the summer wore away, and the
cold, lonely winter months came on, and there
was no one to keep his fire burning and the
wind from sweeping through his home, and no
one to smile upon him and comfort him when
he came back tired from his hard day's work,
Peter grew lonely, and thought he must find a
wife.</p>

<p>So he went to a market town, a whole day's
journey off; for he knew it was a fair-day, and
that all the young women of his acquaintance
would be there, and many more beside.</p>

<p>At first he looked about for the most beautiful,
and asked her if she would be his wife;
but the beauty tossed her head, and answered,
not unless he lived in a two-story house, and
had carpets on his floors, and a wagon in which
she could drive to town when she chose.</p>

<p>All this, was very unlike the home of poor
Peter, who had nothing in the world but his
rough little cabin and a barrow in which he
wheeled his wood.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>
<p>The next maiden told him he had an ugly
scar on his face, and was not good looking
enough for her; and, besides, his clothes were
coarse. The next declared that she was afraid
of wolves, and would rather marry one of the
village youths, and live where she could hear
the news, and on fair-days watch the people
come and go.</p>

<p>So Peter started for his lonely home again,
with a sadder heart than he left it; for there
was no chance that he could ever grow handsome
or rich, and therefore he thought he must
always dwell alone; instead of the music of
kind voices, with which he had hoped to make
his evenings pleasant, he was still to hear only
the cracking of boughs, and hissing of snakes,
and the barking of wolves.</p>

<p>But suddenly he met in the road some people
who seemed more wretched than himself&mdash;an
old, bent woman, clad in rags, and with
such an ugly face that, strong man as he was,
Peter could not look at her without trembling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
and a girl whom she led, or rather
dragged along, through the dusty road.</p>

<p>The girl looked as if she had been weeping
and was very tired; she did not raise her
swollen eyes from the ground while Peter
talked with her companion. The old dame
said she was a silly thing, crying her eyes
out because her mother was dead, when she
ought to be thankful to be rid of one so old,
and sick, and troublesome.</p>

<p>The girl began to cry again, and the woman
to scold her loudly. "Just so ungrateful people
are," she said; "when I have promised to
find a place where you can live at service,
and earn money to buy a new gown, you
must needs whimper about the old body that's
well enough in her grave."</p>

<p>"Perhaps the poor child is lonely," said
Peter, who had a kind heart under his rough
coat, and knew, besides, from his own experience,
what a hard thing it is to live with
no one to love us and be grateful for our
care.</p>

<hr />

<p><a name="Page_12b" id="Page_12b"></a></p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/image02_chap01.jpg" width="430" height="525" alt="SHE PUT THE GIRL&#39;S HAND INTO HIS." title="" /><br />
<span class="smcap">she put the girl's hand into his.</span>
</div>

<hr />

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>
<p>The girl looked up at Peter with her pale,
sad face; but her lips trembled so that she
could not thank him. And he began to think
how this poor beggar must have a gentle and
loving heart, because she had taken such good
care of her old mother, and, notwithstanding
she was so troublesome, had been grieved at
losing her.</p>

<p>So he made bold to ask once more what he
had been refused so many times that day, and
had never thought to ask again, whether she
would marry him, and live in his little cabin,
and cook his meals, and keep his fires burning,
and smile and comfort him when he should
come home tired from his work.</p>

<p>And at these words a bright smile came
into the face of the old woman, and seemed
for an instant to take its ugliness away. She
put the girl's hand into his, and said to her,
"One who can forget his own trouble in comforting
another will make you a good husband,
Susan."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>
<p>All at once the old woman had disappeared;
and Peter and Susan, hand in hand, were travelling
towards the cabin in the wood. They
looked about in every direction; but she was
gone. Then they looked in each other's faces,
and seemed to remember that they had seen
each other before; at least, Peter knew he
had always meant to have exactly such a wife
as Susan, and Susan was sure that, if she had
looked through the world, she could have found
no one so manly, and kind, and generous as
Peter.</p>

<p>I may as well tell you a secret, to begin
with&mdash;that it was no accident which led the
young woman into Peter's path, but a plan
of the old dame. And she was not the withered
hag she seemed, but the youngest and
most beautiful fairy that ever entered this
earth&mdash;the strongest, too, and richest, for
the earth itself is only a part of her treasure;
and should she forsake it for a moment,
our world would wither like a flower cut
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>from its stem, and be blown away with the
first wind that came.</p>

<p>But you must find out for yourselves the
fairy's name.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>
<h4>THE WOODLAND HOME.</h4>

<p>To Susan Peter's cabin seemed like a palace;
for he had taken care that it should
look clean and pleasant when his new wife
came.</p>

<p>It was shaded with the beautiful boughs
of the wood; and the door stood open, for
he had no lock and key. There were inside
some comfortable seats, and a fireplace,
and table, and some wild flowers in a cup;
and on the floor were patches of sunshine
that had crept through the leaves, and made
the room look only cooler and shadier.</p>

<p>Peter opened a closet, and showed his stores
of meal and sugar, and all his pans and
dishes; and he took from his pocket the stuff
for a new gown, which he had bought at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>fair on purpose for his wife, and wheeled from
its dark corner an easy chair he had made for
her, and hung upon the wall a little looking
glass, so that she might not forget, he said, to
keep her hair smooth, and look handsome when
he should come home at evening.</p>

<p>Poor Susan could hardly believe her own
senses: but a few hours ago she had been a
beggar in the streets, without one friend except
the old woman that dragged her through
the dust and scolded her. Many a night they
had slept out of doors, with only a thorny
hedge for shelter and the damp grass for a
bed; and if it rained, and they were out, had
had no fire to dry their shivering limbs; and
when they woke up hungry in the morning, had
no breakfast to cook or eat.</p>

<p>And now the lonely beggar girl was mistress
of a house, and the wife of a man whom
she would not exchange for the whole wide
world, and who seemed pleased with her, and
even proud of her.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>
<p>So you see, dear children, that it is never
worth while to be unhappy about our trials,
because we do not know what may happen
the next minute. We never can guess what
good fortune is travelling towards us, and may,
when times seem darkest, be standing outside
of our door.</p>

<p>The poor debtor in jail may suddenly hear
that he has been made a prince; the dear
friend that is sick, and seems almost sure to
die, may arise all the stronger, and the dearer,
too, for the illness which frightened us; the
sad accident that causes such pain, and perhaps
mutilates us for life, may have kept off from
us some more dreadful pain&mdash;we cannot tell.</p>

<p>But of this we may always be sure, that the
good God, who never sleeps nor grows tired,
loves and watches over us, and sends alike
joy and sorrow, to make our souls purer, and
fitter to live in his beautiful home on high.</p>

<p>Susan never was sorry that the strange old
dame had put her hand in Peter's; for he led
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>her through the pleasantest paths he could find,
and when the way grew rough, he was so careful
of her comfort, and so grieved for her,
that she almost wished it might never be
smooth again.</p>

<p>They were very poor, and worked hard from
morning until night, and often had not quite
clothes enough to wear nor food enough to
eat; but they were satisfied with a little, and
loved each other, and enjoyed their quiet,
shady home.</p>

<p>Many a time they talked over the strange
events of their wedding day, and wondered if
they had really happened, or were only the
recollections of a dream; and Susan would declare
that she had not yet awakened from her
dream, and prayed she never might; for the
cold, cruel, lonely world she always knew before
that day had changed to a beautiful, sunny
home, where she still lived, as merry as a
bird.</p>

<p>Susan was not so ignorant as you might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>think; for before her old mother was taken
sick, she had lived at service, and though unkindly
treated, had learned to do many things,
and could prepare for Peter little comforts of
which he never dreamed before.</p>

<p>She had, too, a pleasant voice, and she and
her husband sang together of evenings; so
that it happened, after his wife came, Peter
never heard the snakes or wolves again.</p>

<p>Ah, and there were more cruel, more fearful
snakes and wolves that Susan kept away. Suppose
she had been ill natured or discontented,
and instead of enjoying her house, had tormented
Peter because it was not a more splendid
one; and when he came home tired, instead
of singing pleasant songs to him, had fretted
about her little troubles, and they had vexed
and quarrelled with each other; do you think
the far-off voices of snakes and wolves outside
would have made the poor man's home as doleful
as those angry, peevish voices within, which
no lock could fasten out?</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>
<h4>DAISY.</h4>

<p>Perhaps by this time you are wondering
what has become of the fairy. This is exactly
what Susan used to wonder; and when, at
evening, she went out to tell Peter that supper
was ready, and it was time for him to
leave off work, if a leaf fell suddenly down,
or a rabbit ran across her path, she would
start and look about cautiously; for it seemed
to her the old woman might at any time come
creeping along under one of the tall arches
which the boughs made on every side, or even
she might be perched among the dusky branches
of the trees.</p>

<p>Peter used to laugh at her, and ask if she
could find nothing pretty and pleasant in all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>the beautiful wood, that she must be forever
searching for that ugly face.</p>

<p>But, to tell the truth, when he walked home
alone after dark, and the wind was dashing
the boughs about, and sighing through them,
and strange-looking shadows came creeping
past him, Peter himself would quicken his
pace, and whistle loudly so as not to hear
the sounds that came thicker and thicker, and
seemed like unearthly voices. He could not
help a feeling, such as Susan had, that the
old fairy was hidden somewhere in the wood,
and that her dreadful face might look up out
of the ground, or from behind some shadowy
rock.</p>

<p>He did not know what a lovely, smiling
face was hidden beneath the dame's wrinkles
and rags; he did not know that this spirit, he
dreaded so much, was his best and kindest
friend; and that, while he feared to meet her,
she was always walking by his side, and keeping
troubles away, and it was even her kind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>hand that parted the boughs sometimes, to let
the sunshine stream upon his little home.</p>

<p>It is very foolish to fear any thing, for
our fears cannot possibly keep danger away;
and suppose we should sometimes meet living
shadows, and dreadful grinning faces, in a
lonely place, it is not likely they would eat
us up; and it is a great deal better and braver
for us to laugh back at them than to be frightened
out of our senses, and run into some
real danger to escape a fancied one.</p>

<p>The fairy was not to be found by seeking
her, but she came at last of her own accord.
When Peter came home from his work, one
night, and passed the place where Susan usually
met him, she was not there; he walked
slowly, for it was a beautiful evening, and he
did not wish to disappoint his wife, who thought
more of her walk with him than of her supper.
No Susan appeared, for all his lingering;
and when his own door was reached,
who should stand there but the old woman,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>her ugly face bright with smiles; and in her
arms a little child, as small, and helpless, and
homely as you would wish to see.</p>

<p>But it belonged to Peter and Susan; and
if children are ever so homely, their own parents
always think them beautiful. You never
saw a person so pleased as Peter; he hugged
his little girl, and danced about with her, and
went out to the door, when it was light, to
look at her face, again and again. It seemed
to him as if a miracle had been wrought on
purpose for him; and already he could fancy
the little one running about his home, building
up gardens out of sticks and stones, and singing
with a voice as musical as her mother's, and
even pleasanter, because it would sound so
childish and innocent.</p>

<p>Of course Susan was pleased with what delighted
Peter so much; and neither of them
minded the little homely face, except once,
when Peter declared it looked like the old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>woman herself, and he was afraid it had caught
her ugliness.</p>

<p>"What's that&mdash;what's that?" exclaimed the
fairy, whom he supposed to have gone away;
for he was too happy to think much about
<i>her</i>. Up she started from Susan's easy chair,
with her great eyes glittering at him, and her
wide mouth opening as if she would devour
the baby.</p>

<p>"I said she looked like her godmother," answered
Peter, holding his child a little closer,
and moving towards the door to look at its
face again.</p>

<p>"Then," cried the old dame, "I must christen
her. There is nothing rich or beautiful about
her looks, and it would be foolish to call her
by a splendid name. She will live in lonely,
lowly places, and grow without any one's help,
and always have a bright, fresh, loving face,
that looks calmly up to heaven: we must call
her Daisy. Take care of her heart, now, Pe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>ter;
and this gift of mine will be a more precious
one than ever was bestowed upon a
queen."</p>

<p>So she fumbled a while in her great pocket,
and brought out a pair of rusty spectacles,
which she offered Peter: but he did not know
this, for he was looking at Susan; and the
fairy laid them upon the little, sleeping bosom
of the child, and hobbled off into the dark, and
was not seen in Peter's house again for many
a day.</p>

<p>"What folly is the meddlesome old dame
about, I wonder?" said Peter to himself, taking
up the spectacles, and about to throw them
away; but the child opened her eyes, and
took them in her little hand in such a knowing
way, he must needs have her mother
see it.</p>

<p>"Dear soul!" exclaimed Susan; "she will
be such a comfort to me, when I am here alone
all day with my work! What shall we name
her? It must be something bright and pleas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>ant;
and it seems to me there is nothing prettier
than Daisy."</p>

<p>Now, while Peter and the old woman were
talking by the door, Susan had been fast asleep,
and had not heard what they said.</p>

<p>"The dame has talked you into that fancy,"
answered Peter. "I should call the little one
Susan."</p>

<p>"What dame?" asked the wife, in surprise.
"You cannot mean that the old woman has
been here."</p>

<p>If he had ever heard Susan speak an untruth,
Peter would have thought she was deceiving
him now; but he felt that she was
good and true, and thought, perhaps, after all,
she had been so drowsy as to forget the
dame's visit; so he patiently told about it,
spectacles and all.</p>

<p>Susan took them in her hand with some curiosity,
and even tried them upon Daisy's face;
they were large and homely, besides being all
over rust. While Daisy wore them, the moon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>light
broke through the boughs again, to show
her little face, looking so old, and wise, and
strange, that Susan snatched the spectacles off,
and threw them into a drawer, where she quite
forgot them, and where they lay, growing rustier,
for years.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>
<h4>GREAT PICTURE BOOKS.</h4>

<p>You would not suppose that Susan's home
could be any different because such a poor
little thing as Daisy had come into it; but
bright and pleasant as it was before, it was
a hundred times brighter and pleasanter now.</p>

<p>The child was so gentle and loving, and
so happy and full of life, that Susan and
Peter felt almost like children themselves, in
watching her. No matter how tired Peter
was at night, he would frolic an hour with
Daisy, tossing the little thing in the air, lifting
her up among the boughs till she was
hidden from sight. And Susan would leave
her work any time to admire Daisy's garden,
or to dress the wooden doll that Peter had
made for her.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>
<p>As for Daisy's self, she was the busiest little
soul alive, after she once learned to walk;
for at first she could only lie and look up
at the leaves, and the great sky, so far, far
off, and see the slow, white clouds sail past
the tops of the trees, and watch the birds,
that hopped from branch to branch and looked
down at her curiously, wondering if she were
any thing good to eat.</p>

<p>Daisy would hold up her little hands, to
tell them they'd better not try, and then the
bird would turn it off by singing away as if
he had no such thought, and watch her as
he warbled his gay little song, that said, "O
Daisy, I'm having a beautiful time; are you?"</p>

<p>Then Daisy would coo, and laugh, and clap
her hands, which was her song, and which
meant, "Yes, indeed; only wait till I can use
my feet, and have a run with you."</p>

<p>Peter made a rough kind of cradle out of
willow twigs, and hung it in a tree, so that
the fresh, green leaves shaded it, and kept
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>away the flies, and fanned Daisy's face, as she
lay there swinging, when the day was warm,
like a little hangbird in her nest.</p>

<p>No wonder the child was always fond of
birds, when she began so early to live with
them and listen to their songs.</p>

<p>But Daisy learned to walk in time; and
then she was constantly flying about, like the
butterflies she loved. For the little girl thought
even more of butterflies than of birds; they
seemed to her like beautiful flowers sailing
through the air, and making calls upon the
other flowers, that were fastened down to the
earth,&mdash;poor things!&mdash;as she used to be before
she learned to walk.</p>

<p>She would pick the flowers sometimes, and
toss them into the air to see if they didn't
fly, and tell them they were silly things to
fall back on the ground and wilt, when, if
they only would not be afraid, they might
float off, with all their wings, and see a little
of the world.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>
<p>Daisy's hands were always full of flowers;
and she brought some to the cabin which Susan
had never seen before; for the good woman
could not leave her work long enough to go
in such out-of-the-way places as they chose to
blossom in.</p>

<p>Daisy had no work except to amuse herself;
and she never tired of trudging under the trees,
crowding her way among the tall weeds by
the river bank, and creeping behind great rocks,
or into soft, mossy places in the heart of the
quiet wood; and here she was sure of finding
strange and lovely things.</p>

<p>These were the little girl's books; she had
no spelling and history like yours, but studied
the shapes of leaves and clouds, and the sunshine,
and river, and birds.</p>

<p>She did not know all their names, but could
tell you where the swallow lived, and where
wild honeysuckles grew, and the humming bird
hid her little eggs, and how many nuts the
squirrel was hoarding for winter time, and how
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>nicely the ant had cleaned her house for spring,
and when the winged seeds on the maple tree
would change to broad green leaves, and the
leaves themselves would change to colors as
gay as the sunset, and then all droop and
wither, and leave the bright little stars to
wink at her through the naked boughs.</p>

<p>The birds all knew Daisy, and were not
afraid of her; they would bring their young
ones about the door, that she might feed them
with crumbs and seeds. And even the sly
little rabbits, that started if a leaf fell, came
quietly and nibbled grass from Daisy's hands,
and let her stroke their long, soft ears.</p>

<p>You may wonder that Susan was not afraid
the snakes and wolves would devour her little
girl; but, as I told you before, she never
could help thinking that the old woman was
somewhere in the wood, and remembering how
she had smiled at looking into the baby's face,
thought she would not let Daisy come to any
harm.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>
<p>And she was right; for the fairy only lifted
her finger when the little girl passed, and the
wolf that had begun to watch and growl at
her would crouch back in his den, and fall
asleep.</p>

<p>But he would not have frightened Daisy,
had he come forth; she did not know the
name of fear, and, glad to see a new play-fellow,
would perhaps have climbed on his back,
and, patting his mouth so gently with her little
hand that he forgot to growl, would have
told him now he might gallop along, and take
her home to her mother.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>
<h4>TROUBLE FOR DAISY.</h4>

<p>It was fortunate that Susan was so happy
while she could be; for the poor woman little
dreamed how soon her sunny home was to
become a sad, dark place for her.</p>

<p>Peter used to go forth in the morning,
whistling as gayly as any of the birds; and
Daisy following him, proud enough that she
could carry his little dinner basket for the
short way she went.</p>

<p>She did not know that what was such a
heavy load to her was only a feather for the
strong man to lift, and so delighted in thinking
she had grown old enough to help her
dear father.</p>

<p>Still Peter had to watch his dinner closely;
for Daisy would espy some beautiful flower or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>vine looking at her from away off in the
shade; and down the basket would go, and
the little girl was off to take a nearer look,
and see if she could not break off a branch
to carry home to her mother.</p>

<p>Sometimes Peter walked so fast, or Daisy
staid so long, that they lost each other; and
then the father made a call that could be
heard for miles, which frightened all the birds
home to their nests, and must have startled
the old dame herself, wherever she might be
lurking in the wood.</p>

<p>But the call was music to Daisy; and before
many minutes, she would come bounding
into her father's arms, almost hidden in the
waving white blossoms with which she had
loaded herself.</p>

<p>And all this while, unless Peter himself took
care of it, what would become of his dinner!</p>

<p>When Susan went to meet her husband at
evening, now, Daisy was sure to be with her&mdash;one
moment holding her hand, the next skipping
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>away alone, or kneeling to gather bright pebbles
and sheets of green moss, to make banks
and paths in her garden. She fluttered about
in the sunshine like the butterflies she loved,
and was as harmless and gentle.</p>

<p>But, alas! one night, no Peter came to meet
them; and though Daisy kept thinking she
heard his step or his voice, it could only be
the fall of some dead limb or the hooting of
an owl.</p>

<p>The night grew darker, and it lightened so
sharply that Daisy clung to her mother's skirts,
and begged her to hide somewhere under a
rock until the storm should be past, as the
little girl felt almost sure her father had done.</p>

<p>But Susan groped her way on, with the wind
blowing the branches into their faces, and the
dead boughs snapping and falling about them,
and the snakes, that they had never seen before,
gliding across the path, hissing, and running
their forked tongues out with fear.</p>

<p>And at length they found poor Peter, dead,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>on the ground. The tree which he had been
cutting down had fallen suddenly, and crushed
his head so under its great trunk that they
only knew him by his clothes.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>
<h4>THE SWEETEST FLOWER.</h4>

<p>Small as Daisy was, she saw that her father
could never speak to her again; she remembered
how kind he had always been; how
many good times they had had together; how,
that very morning, he had waited, on his way
to work, and climbed a tall tree, only to tell
her whether the eggs were hatched in the blue-jay's
nest.</p>

<p>She thought, too, how he had let her go farther
than usual, and then walked back with
her part way, to be sure she was in the right
path, and how gently he had kissed her at
parting, and told her to be a good girl, and
help her mother.</p>

<p>Ah, she would take care to do that now, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>never forget the last words which her dear
father spoke to her.</p>

<p>When our friends are taken away, we remember
every little kind word, or look, or
smile they ever gave us&mdash;things we hardly
noticed while they were alive; and Daisy could
remember only kindness, only smiles and pleasant
words. She thought no one could ever
have had so good a father as Peter was to
her, and that no little girl could be so lonely
and wretched as she was now.</p>

<p>Who was there left to call her up in the
morning before the birds, and to make her
garden tools, and swing her in the boughs, and
listen to her stories at night about the rabbits
and flowers? It seemed as if her heart
would break.</p>

<p>But Daisy had one pleasant thought to comfort
her&mdash;it seemed like a sweet flower that
her father had dropped down from his new
home in paradise, and which she would always
wear in her bosom; and perhaps he would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>know her by it when, after a great many
years, she should go to live with him there.</p>

<p>This dear thought was, that when Peter
lived, she had done every thing in her power
to please him and make him forget his weariness,
and that he had known of this thoughtfulness,
and loved her for it, and had always
felt younger and happier when she was by
his side.</p>

<p>If your brothers and sisters or parents die,
whether by accident or sickness, are you sure
that they would leave you such a comforter as
Daisy had? Think about it; for when you
stand by their coffins, and it is too late to
change the past, and the cold lips have spoken
their last word, this little flower will be worth
more to you&mdash;though no one may see it except
yourself&mdash;than all the treasure in the world.</p>

<p>But if you have been cold and cruel, there
will come into your heart, instead, when you
think of them, a dismal shadow, which all the
light of the blessed sun cannot drive away.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>
<h4>THE WOODMAN'S FUNERAL.</h4>

<p>Daisy did not see the lightning, nor hear
the snakes, nor feel the drops of rain that
began to patter down; she only felt the cold
hand that would never lead her through the
wood again; for when she lifted it, it fell
back on the ground, dead&mdash;dead!</p>

<p>She asked her mother if they were not going
home; but Susan said her home was with
Peter; and if he staid out in the dark wood,
she must stay there, too. She was frightened,
and wild with sorrow, and did not know what
she was saying, and began, at last, to blame
the old woman, who had brought her there,
she said, to be so happy for a little while,
and always afterwards lonely and wretched&mdash;the
old hag!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>
<p>"What old hag!" said a voice close to
Susan's ear, that brought her senses back
quickly. "Is this all your gratitude, Susan?
And are you going to kill your child, out
here, with the cold and damp, because your
husband's gone? Come! we must bury him;
and then away to your home, and don't sit
here, abusing your best friend."</p>

<p>Daisy, you know, had never seen the woman,
and she had never looked so dreadfully as
now; she was pale and starved, and her great
eyes glittered like the eyes of the snakes, and
her voice was sharp and shrill enough to have
frightened one on a pleasanter night than that.</p>

<p>With Peter's axe the fairy sharpened two
stout sticks; one of these she made Susan take,
and there, by the light of the quick flashes of
lightning, and a little lantern that the woman
wore like a brooch on her bosom, Daisy
watched them dig her father's grave.</p>

<p>The fallen tree was one of the largest in
the wood, and the two women could not lift
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>it; so they dug the earth away at the side and
underneath the trunk; and when the place was
deep enough, poor Peter's body dropped into
its grave. While her mother and the fairy
were filling it over with earth, Daisy went for
the moss which she had gathered to show her
father, and, by the light of the fairy's lamp,
picked the sweetest flowers, and fragrant grasses,
and broad leaves that glistened with the rain,
and scattered them on the spot.</p>

<p>Then, with one of Susan's and one of Daisy's
hands in hers, the old dame hurried them out
of the wood. They stumbled often over the
broken boughs, and stepped, before they knew
it, on the snakes, that only hissed and slid
away among the grass. Susan was crying bitterly,
and their guide kept scolding her, and
Daisy heard the wolves growl in their dens.</p>

<p>She had heard of great funerals, where there
were carriages and nodding plumes, and heavy
velvet palls, and bells tolling mournfully; but
Daisy thought it was because her father had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>been such a good man, that his funeral was so
much grander.</p>

<p>She knew that all about his grave, and
on, on, farther than eye could see, the great
forest trees were bending and nodding like
black plumes, and sounds like groans and sighs
came from them as they dashed together in
the wind; the lightning was his funeral torch;
and the thunder tolled, instead of bells, at
Peter's grave; and the black clouds swept on
like a train of mourners; and the great, quick
drops of rain made it seem as if all the sky
were weeping tears of pity for the little girl.</p>

<p>Ah, and Daisy could not see how the dreadful
old woman only seemed such, and was, in
truth, a good and gentle fairy, who meant still
to watch over the little orphan with tender
care, as she had always done; whose soft,
white wings, even now, were spread above, to
shelter her from the cold rain and wind, and
whose kind heart was full of pity for that
little aching heart of hers.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>
<p>You and I, and all the people we know,
walk through the world with this same strange
fairy; who seems to frown, and scold, and
force us on through cruel storms, and yet who
is really smiling upon us, and shielding our
shrinking forms with tender care, and leading
us gently home.</p>

<p>Have you thought yet what can be the
fairy's name?</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>
<h4>DAISY'S MISSION.</h4>

<p>No sooner had Daisy stepped inside of her
mother's door, than there came such a crash
of thunder as she had never heard; and the
little house shook as if it must surely fall.</p>

<p>The old trees ground their boughs together,
and, blown by the wind, the night birds
dashed with their wet wings against the door;
the screech owl hooted, for the young were
washed out of her nest; and the rain leaked
under Susan's door sill, ran across the floor,
and put out the little fire of brushwood which
was burning on the hearth.</p>

<p>And Daisy thought of her father, out alone
in this fearful night, and how the cold rain
must be dripping into his grave.</p>

<p>She peeped through the window. The sharp,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>jagged lightning made the sky look as if it
were shattering like a dome of glass. She
wondered if that lightning might not be the
light of heaven she had heard about, and
whether, if the sky should really fall, heaven
and earth would be one place, and by taking
a long, long journey, she could find her father,
and live with him. And she thought that, for
the sake of having him to take her by the
hand again, she would walk to the end of a
hundred worlds.</p>

<p>Then the sky seemed to Daisy like a great
black bell; and the thunder was the tongue
of it that tolled so dismally over her father's
grave.</p>

<p>She was startled by a bony hand laid upon
her shoulder, and looking up, heard the old
woman say in her sharp, shrill voice, "Come,
little girl! don't you know I am hungry after
all this work? Fly round, and get me something
to eat."</p>

<p>And when Daisy noticed her poor, starved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>face, she wondered that she had not thought
to offer her some food.</p>

<p>So she went to the closet,&mdash;the same one
which poor Peter had shown to his wife with
so much pride,&mdash;and pointed to bread and a
dish of milk,&mdash;for the shelves were so high
that Daisy could not reach them,&mdash;and drew
her mother's easy chair into the dryest place
she could find, and begged the dame to seat
herself.</p>

<p>She did not wait to be asked twice, but
hobbled into the chair, and, to Daisy's wonder,
ate all the bread at a mouthful, and drank
the milk at a swallow, and then, looking as
hungry as ever, asked for more.</p>

<p>So the little girl brought meat, and then
some meal, and some dried fruit, and even
cracked nuts; but the more she brought, the
more the fairy wanted.</p>

<p>If Daisy had feared any thing, she would
have trembled when, at last, the old dame fixed
her glittering eyes upon her, and began to talk.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>
<p>"Couldn't you do any better, Daisy, than
this," she said, "for your mother's friend and
yours? Are you not ashamed, when I am so
hungry and tired, to give me such mean
food?"</p>

<p>"I am sorry, if you do not like it," said
Daisy; "it is the best we ever have."</p>

<p>"Don't tell me that," and the dame began to
look angry. "Do you call it good food that
leaves me thin as I was before, and as hungry,
and my clothes as ragged, and does not
rest or soothe my poor old aching bones?"</p>

<p>"If you wait till mother has done crying,
she can make a drink out of herbs that will
stop the aching&mdash;I am sure of that," said
Daisy, looking up in the fairy's face.</p>

<p>"But I want it now; and, O, I am so cold!
and she will cry all night. Do, Daisy, find
me something else to eat."</p>

<p>The poor old woman shivered as she spoke,
and tears came into her eyes.</p>

<p>"If it were daytime, I could find you ber<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>ries
and nuts out doors, for mother says I
have sharp eyes."</p>

<p>"Have you&mdash;have you? And could you
find my hut? There is a beautiful loaf of
bread and a flask of medicine on the table.
O, dear! this dreadful pain again!" and the
ugly face grew uglier, as its wrinkles seemed
all knotting up with agony.</p>

<p>"I am almost sure I could find it, and I
am so sorry your bones ache; pray, let me
try."</p>

<p>"What! go out into the dreadful night, with
the owls, and wolves, and snakes, and with
bats flapping their wings in your face, and the
thunder rolling and rumbling overhead?"</p>

<p>"None of these things ever hurt me, and I
don't believe they will now. May I try?"</p>

<p>"Just listen to the wind and rain, and see
the lightning cut through the darkness like a
sword; and think, Daisy, if you should see
your father, just as he lay in the wood, with
his head all crushed."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>
<p>"My father has gone to heaven," said the
little girl; "that is only his body out in the
woods, just as that is his coat on the wall;
and I shall see nothing except the nice loaf
of bread and the medicine, and think only
how they will cure your pain."</p>

<p>Without another word, the fairy took the
lantern from her bosom, and fastening it to
Daisy's, led her to the door, and pointed out
into the black night.</p>

<p>"Who could see to hurt me, when it is so
dark!" the little girl exclaimed. "Now, tell
me which way I shall turn, and see if I am
not back soon."</p>

<p>"Walk only where the light of the lantern
falls." She was saying more; but the wind
slammed the door suddenly, and Daisy found
herself alone.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX.</h3>
<h4>FAIRY FOOD.</h4>

<p>The lantern made a little pathway of light,
sometimes leading straight forward, sometimes
turning, running among thick bushes or over
the rocks; and Daisy went bravely on, never
minding the frightened birds that fluttered
through her light, like moths, nor the sad sigh
of the wind, nor the dripping trees.</p>

<p>She looked for pleasant things, instead of
frightful ones; and let me whisper to you,
that, with fairy help or without it, we always
find, in this world, what we are looking for.</p>

<p>The mosses seemed like a green carpet for
her feet, and the pebbles like shining jewels;
and the little flowers looked up at her like
friends, and seemed to say, "We are smaller
and weaker than you are, Daisy; but we
stay out here every night, and nothing harms
us."</p>

<p>And the trees bowed, and folded their
leaves above her, as she passed, so gently, that
she thought they were trying to shelter and
take care of her.</p>

<p>At length the light paused before a rock;
but Daisy could find no house, until she parted
a clump of bushes, and then saw the entrance
to a cave.</p>

<p>She crept in; and as her lantern filled the
place with light, she saw what a damp, uncomfortable
home the old dame had, with only
some stones for seats, and a table, and a ragged
bed, and a smoky corner where she built
her fire.</p>

<p>There, however, upon the table stood the
loaf and flask which Daisy had come to find;
she took them and hurried away, for it seemed
as if the old dame's face were looking at her
out of the rocky wall on every side.</p>

<p>It was a heavier load for the little girl
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
than her father's basket had been; but she
had a strong heart, if her hands were weak.
She ran along, trying to get before the light,
that was always just in front of her, and singing
the merriest songs she knew, so as not to
hear the wind nor think about the faces on
the wall.</p>

<p>She reached home safely, but could not open
the door; for the latch was high, and the
dame had gone fast asleep. Daisy thought she
must wait until daylight out there in the cold,
and sat on the step, feeling disappointed and
sad enough.</p>

<p>But one of her tame rabbits, awakened, perhaps,
more easily than the dame, hopped out
of his burrow, and nestled in Daisy's lap, and
looked up at her with his gentle eyes, while
she warmed her hands in his fur, and did not
feel so much alone.</p>

<p>At last the old woman started from her
sleep, and wondering what had become of Daisy,
went to look for her.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>
<p>She seized the bread with a cry of joy, and
breaking a morsel, ate it eagerly, as she led
Daisy towards the fire, which she had built
up again.</p>

<p>"Now, see the difference between your food
and mine." As the fairy spoke, Daisy looked
up, and saw, to her surprise, the wrinkles
smooth away, and a beautiful light break over
the old brown face, the wide mouth shrink to
a little rosy one, all smiles, and pearly teeth
inside. The fairy's eyes grew brighter than
ever; but the dreadful glittering look had
gone, and they were full of joy, and peace,
and love.</p>

<p>"Wait, now, till I take my medicine." Her
voice had changed to the softest, most silvery
one that Daisy ever heard.</p>

<p>And when she had tasted the drink, her
poor old crooked hands grew plump and white,
her bent form straightened, and, what made
Daisy wonder more, even her clothes began to
change.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>
<p>First they looked cleaner, then not so faded,
then the rags disappeared, and they seemed
new and whole; and then they began to grow
soft and rich, till the ragged cotton gown was
changed to velvet and satin, the knotted old
turban to delicate lace, that hung heavy with
pearls, but was not so delicate and beautiful
as the golden hair that floated about the fairy
wherever she moved.</p>

<p>"Poor child!" she said; "you are tired and
cold; come, rest with me;" and taking Daisy
in her arms, began to sing the sweetest songs,
that seemed to change every thing into music,
even the wailing tempest and her mother's
sobs.</p>

<p>And all the while that tender, loving face
bent over her, and the gentle hands were
smoothing her wet hair, and folding her more
closely to the fairy's heart.</p>

<p>Upon this pillow our tired Daisy fell asleep.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER X.</h3>
<h4>DAISY'S DREAMS.</h4>

<p>Strange and pleasant dreams came to Daisy
as she slept; and in all of them she could
see the beautiful fairy floating over her head,
and her father walking by her side.</p>

<p>It seemed to her that, as she watched the
lightning, the sky really broke like a dome of
glass, and came shattering down, and that after
it floated the loveliest forms, and odors and
music came pouring down, and light which was
far clearer, and yet not so dazzling as the
light of earth.</p>

<p>The clouds came floating towards her, and
all their golden edges were bright wings, that
waved in time with the music; then came falling,
falling slowly as snow flakes, what seemed
little pearly clouds, but blossomed into flowers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
and then changed into sweet faces, that all
smiled on her as they passed by.</p>

<p>Among these the little girl searched eagerly
for her father's face, when all at once he took
her in his arms, and said, "Ha, my Daisy! is
it you?" in his own merry, pleasant way.</p>

<p>This startled her so much that she awoke,
only to fall asleep again, and dream another
dream as wonderful.</p>

<p>But at length the morning sun had crept
around the side of the cottage, found its way
through the window, and fell so full on Daisy's
face, that she could dream only of dazzling,
dazzling light, which seemed burning into
her eyes, and made her open them wide, at
length.</p>

<p>And then, alas! how every thing was changed!
Her first thought was of the fairy; but she
had gone, and Daisy had been sleeping in
her mother's easy chair, and felt cold and
lonely as she looked around upon the silent
room.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>
<p>No music there, no flowers and angelic faces,
and clouds like chariots of pearl, with golden
wings to hurry them along; no father to take
her in his arms, and call her his little Daisy.</p>

<p>She closed her eyes, and tried to sleep again,
for it seemed to her a great deal better to
dream than to be awake in such a dreary
little world as that. But suddenly Daisy thought
of her mother, and almost at the very moment
was aroused by a moan from another part of
the room.</p>

<p>She ran to Susan's side, and found her sick,
and wretched as she was the night before;
so Daisy bathed her head, and brought her
some fresh water from the spring; and when
she could not comfort her in any other way,
began to tell her dreams, how she had seen her
father again, and felt sure he must be still
alive.</p>

<p>As Susan listened, she dried her tears, and
kissed Daisy so fondly that the little girl no
longer wished to be asleep, but was glad that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>she had power to run about, and prattle, and
amuse her lonely mother.</p>

<p>For she remembered Peter's last words now,
that she must be a good girl, and help, not
herself, not sit still and have pleasant dreams,
but help her mother.</p>

<p>And this Daisy felt resolved to do, if only
for his sake.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI.</h3>
<h4>THE DAME'S BUNDLE.</h4>

<p>As soon as her mother smiled once more,
Daisy asked her what had become of the splendid
fairy, and when she would be back again,
and how it happened that the light and music
had gone with her from their home.</p>

<p>Susan had seen no fairy, and could not believe
that Daisy was thinking of the poor old
wrinkled dame. When she told the story of
her journey to the cave, and the loaf of fairy
bread, and the old dame's sudden change, the
mother stroked Daisy's hair, and said that this
was only another of her wonderful dreams, and
that, instead of going to the rain, the rain
had come to her, pelting upon the window so
hard, it had, perhaps, sprinkled her face&mdash;that
was all; and the light of the fairy was,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>she supposed, the light of the morning sun,
that had pried her little sleepy lids apart, at
last.</p>

<p>Daisy felt bewildered and sorrowful at this,
for she did not like to give up her new friend;
but her mother told her how long she had
known the dame; how she had put her hand
in Peter's, years ago; and afterwards put
Daisy in his arms, a little thing, no larger
than her wooden doll, that could only lie in
the grass or swing in its nest among the
boughs, and look up at the sky.</p>

<p>Daisy thought, if she could have such another
dear little thing to play with, and love, and
tell her stories to, she should be contented
with her home, and willing to wait for her
father, and forget the vision of the fairy that
had folded her so tenderly in her arms.</p>

<p>So she went on asking questions about the
dame; and then her mother remembered the
gift of the iron spectacles. Of course Daisy
wished to see them; but where they were no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>one knew. And Susan consoled her by saying
they were but homely and worthless things.</p>

<p>"All things are worthless unless we make
use of them," said the shrill voice of the dame,
who in her sudden way appeared all at once
in the room.</p>

<p>"I only wonder that I don't grow tired of
helping you," she said; "for you give me nothing
except ingratitude. Here, take this, and
see what fault you can find with it."</p>

<p>She tossed a bundle into Susan's arms, put
a loaf on the table, and pointed Daisy to the
rubbish heap outside the door; then frowning
angrily at Susan, "Pretty extravagance! to
make believe you are poor, and throw away
what is worth more than all the gold on earth.
Why didn't you make the child wear my gift?"</p>

<p>"She was homely enough, at first, without
it," Susan answered; "and after she grew better
looking, why should I waste my time looking
up those old rusty spectacles, to make her
a fright again?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>
<p>"You will have no such trouble with the
other one." As the fairy spoke, a lovely little
face peeped out from the bundle in Susan's
arms. "Now, tell what I shall give her, with
her name."</p>

<p>Susan had never seen such a beautiful child,
and, poor as she was, felt grateful to the dame
for this new gift; but she begged for leave
to name the little one herself.</p>

<p>"I will call it Peterkin, after my husband.
Ah, how the dear man would have loved it!"
And Susan began to cry.</p>

<p>"Then her name will not match her face;
if you want a Peterkin, I will bring you one
instead of this; but her name must be Maud."</p>

<p>So Susan gave up the name for the sake of
the child's good looks, and begged the dame
to keep her always so beautiful, and to make
her rich.</p>

<p>"That's easy enough; you should have asked
me, Susan, to make her heart rich and beautiful.
Yet rich she shall be; and no one in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>all the earth shall have so handsome a face.
But, remember, it is on one condition I promise&mdash;that
Maud and Daisy shall always live together,
rich or poor; that they shall never
spend a night apart, until Daisy goes to live
with her father again."</p>

<p>Susan promised, and was thanking the dame
with all her heart, though looking at the lovely
little face that nestled in her bosom, when
Daisy flew into the room.</p>

<p>"O mother, mother! I've seen her again, and
prettier than she was at first. She smiled at
me, and stroked my hair, and then went floating
off among the trees, like all the faces in
my dream."</p>

<p>"Then she and the dame are not one; for,
look!"</p>

<p>"Look where? Has the dame been here
again?"</p>

<p>"To be sure; I was talking with her when
you came; and the door has not been opened
since."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>
<p>But no old woman was in sight; Daisy
looked under the table, and in the closet, and
every dark corner; but she was not there;
and the little girl told her mother that she
must have been dreaming, now.</p>

<p>But Susan showed her what the dame had
brought, and even put the little thing in Daisy's
arms. It was hardly larger than a bird,
and pretty as a flower, and as helpless, too.</p>

<p>And Daisy almost forgot the fairy in this
new delight; she thought that all the visions
in the air were not so sweet and lovely as
her sister's face. She could not look at it
enough; and at length taking out from her
pocket a pair of spectacles, gravely put them
on, and looked at her sister again.</p>

<p>Susan laughed; she couldn't help it, Daisy
looked so drolly. She saw that the spectacles
were the very ones the dame had brought; for
she thought there could hardly be another pair
so old and rusty in the world.</p>

<p>The little girl said she had found them in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>a dust heap, where Susan remembered that she
had emptied the rubbish from some old boxes,
the day before. Daisy had but just cleaned the
glasses with her apron, and was holding them
up to find if they were clear, when she saw,
through them, the beautiful fairy floating by,
and smiling on her as she passed.</p>

<p>She thought, after all, it might have been
the glasses that had changed the sour old woman
into a smiling fairy; but when she looked
at her sister's sweet little face through them,
it was not half so beautiful&mdash;it seemed cold
and hungry, and the smile was gone.</p>

<p>Susan felt very sure that the dame was real,
for all about her were the care and trouble
she had brought; and had she not dragged her
on through cruel storms, and scolded her when
she was trying to do her best? And if the
beautiful smiling vision was real, why did it
always float away?</p>

<p>Susan forgot that the dame, too, floated
away when her errands were done.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>
<p>So Daisy did not know but she had been
dreaming again, though with her eyes wide
open; and yet she could not forget how softly
she had been folded once in the fairy's arms.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was because the little girl believed
in her, and was always watching and
hoping to see her again, that the beautiful
bright form sometimes floated past her eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XII.</h3>
<h4>A LEAF OUT OF DAISY'S BOOK.</h4>

<p>After a great many days of rain, the storm
ceased; and glad enough was Daisy, for she
had grown tired of staying in the house, or of
being drenched and almost blown away when
she ventured out of doors.</p>

<p>The sun came out, one morning, and did not
hide in clouds again, as usual, but poured its
beautiful beams down on the earth, till the dark
forest trees seemed touched with gold, and the
little drooping flowers lifted up their heads
once more.</p>

<p>Daisy, as she looked from the cabin window,
and saw and heard the raging storm, had often
wondered what would become of her friends
the birds&mdash;if their nests would not be shaken
from the trees, and their little unfledged young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>ones would not shiver with cold. Then, too,
the butterflies, she feared, would have their
bright wings washed away or broken; and the
flowers would have their petals shaken off, and
be snapped from their slender stems.</p>

<p>But we are apt to dread a great deal worse
things than ever happen to us; and though
Daisy did find some fallen nests and dead birds
scattered on the ground, she could see that the
storm had done more good than harm.</p>

<p>For every bird there were hundreds of insects
lying dead&mdash;not bees and butterflies, but
worms and bugs, that bite the flowers, and
make them shrivel up and fade, and that gnaw
the leaves off the trees and all the tender
buds, and sting and waste the fruit.</p>

<p>The toads were having a feast over the bodies
of these little mischief makers; and the birds
were swinging on the tips of the leafy boughs,
and singing enough to do your heart good;
bees came buzzing about as busily as though
they meant to make up for all the time they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>had lost; and a beautiful butterfly, floating
through the sunshine, settled upon a flower at
Daisy's feet, and waved his large wings, that
looked soft and dry as if there had never been
a drop of rain.</p>

<p>Then the trees were so bright and clean,
with the dust all washed away, and fresh as
if they had just been made; they waved together
with a pleasant sound, that Daisy thought
was like a song of joy and praise; and every
little leaf joined in the chorus, far and wide,
stirring, and skimming, and breathing that low
hymn of happiness.</p>

<p>The wood was fragrant, too; and in all its
hollows stood bright little pools, that reflected
the sky, and sparkled back to the sun; the
grass and flowers had grown whole inches since
Daisy saw them last, and the mosses were green
as emerald.</p>

<p>Quite near the cabin, though hidden from
it by the trees, was a wide river, that had
swollen with the rain, and was rushing on with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>a sound so loud that it shook the leaves, and
seemed like a mighty voice calling to Daisy
from a great way off.</p>

<p>So she found her way to its shore, and saw
that the bridge across it had been swept away;
and as it went foaming and tearing along,
whole trees, and boats, and rafts were whirling
in the tide that was rushing on, on, on,
she wondered where.</p>

<p>Then the little girl remembered how long
she had been away from home, and hurried
back to tell her mother about the bridge, stopping
now and then to snatch a flower as she
passed. Her hands were full when she bounded
into the cabin; and she looked as bright,
and fresh, and full of joy as any thing out
doors.</p>

<p>But her mother sat in a corner, feeling very
sad, and hardly looked at Daisy's flowers, and
said it was nothing to her how bright the
sun shone so long as it never could rest again
on Peter's face.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>
<p>"Why," said Daisy, "I thought father was
happy in heaven, and where he did not have
to work so hard, and there were never any
storms, and the flowers were prettier than
these."</p>

<p>"That is true enough," Susan answered; "but
it will not keep us from being lonely, and
cold, and hungry, too, sometimes."</p>

<p>"But we are not hungry now, and perhaps
the queer old dame may bring us some more
of her bread, or else I'm pretty sure the fairy
will take care of us. Who feeds the flowers,
mother?"</p>

<p>"God."</p>

<p>"What, ours&mdash;up in heaven?"</p>

<p>"There is only one God, Daisy; he gives us
meat and milk, and gives the flowers dew and
air."</p>

<p>"Then I suppose they were thinking about
him this morning."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because, when I first went out, they seemed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>as if they were dreaming&mdash;just as I felt when
I dreamed; so that I wondered if they hadn't
seen the fairy pass, or if their eyes were sharper
than ours, and they could see faces floating in
the air when there were none for us. It was
damp, at first, and there were great shadows;
but presently the sunshine poured in every
where, and still they kept looking straight up
into the sky&mdash;a whole field of them, down by
the river bank; and, do see! even these I've
brought you are looking up now at our wall
as if they could see through it. If God can
see through walls, can't we, when we are looking
after him?"</p>

<p>"I don't know but we might, Daisy. You
ask strange questions."</p>

<p>"Just answer one more, mother. If the flowers
have the same God with us, why do they always
look so happy, and beautiful, and young?
Does he think more of them than he does
of us?"</p>

<p>"No, child&mdash;not half so much. We suffer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>because God made us wiser than the flowers."</p>

<p>"Why, they get trampled on, and beaten in
the wind, and have their stems broken, and
have to stay out doors in the cold all night,
(Daisy was thinking of her midnight walk,) and
sometimes they don't have any sunshine for a
week: we should call that trouble, and I know
what I think about it."</p>

<p>"Tell me."</p>

<p>"Why, you see, the flowers are always looking
at the sky, and don't mind what is happening
around them, nor wait to think who
may step on their pretty faces. Suppose we
are wiser; why can't we live as they do, mother,
and think about God and heaven, instead of
always ourselves?"</p>

<p>"I know a little girl who lives very much
like them now," said Daisy's mother, kissing
her. "But, my dear child, how strangely you
have looked ever since you put on those old
spectacles!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>
<p>"Why, am I not the same Daisy? Am I
changing to a fairy, like the dame?"</p>

<p>"I fear not; they leave a sort of shadow
on your face, and make you homely. It seems
to me, Daisy, I'd throw the old things away."</p>

<p>"O, don't say that&mdash;not if they make me
like the old woman herself. I guess it doesn't
matter much how we look down here."</p>

<p>"Down where?"</p>

<p>"Why, on the earth; for you know father
was not handsome; and when I saw him in
heaven, in my dream, O, he had such a beautiful
face!"</p>

<p>So Daisy went on prattling about her father
until Susan dried her tears; for when she
thought of Peter now, it was not the poor
crushed body in the wood, which she had wept
about, but the beautiful, smiling angel in paradise.</p>

<p>And when cares gathered thicker about her,
and want seemed so near that Susan grew
discouraged, Daisy would bring her flowers;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>and the mother would remember then how
they were always looking up to the kind God,
and so look up herself, and thinking about him,
forget her sorrows and her cares.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII.</h3>
<h4>MAUD.</h4>

<p>The little Maud grew more beautiful every
day; she was fair as a lily, except that you
might think rose leaves had been crushed to
color her cheeks. Her bright eyes were shaded
by long, silky lashes; and her pretty mouth,
when it was shut, concealed two rows of delicate,
pearly teeth. Her hair hung in a cloud
of dark-brown curls, touched on the edges with
a golden tinge.</p>

<p>The old dame took care that her dress
should be always fine; and while she gave
Daisy the coarsest woollen gowns, brought delicate
muslins for Maud.</p>

<p>But Daisy did not mind this; she was glad
to see her beautiful sister dressed handsomely;
and, besides, how could she crowd through the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>bushes by the river bank, or sit on the ground
looking at grass and flowers through her spectacles,
if her own dresses were so frail?</p>

<p>It was not, after all, so very amusing as
Daisy had hoped, to take care of Miss Maud,
when she began to run about and play. She
did not dare to go in the wood, for fear of
bugs and snakes; she did not like to sail chips
in the river, and make believe they were boats;
she tossed away Daisy's wooden doll, and called
it a homely thing; she pulled up her sister's
flowers, and always wanted to go in a different
place and do a different thing from her.</p>

<p>The little girl found it hard to give up so
many pleasures; but she kept thinking that
Maud would be older soon, and would know
better than to be so troublesome.</p>

<p>And Maud was no sooner large enough to
run about than Daisy wished her young again;
for she took pains to tread on the prettiest
flowers, and call them old weeds, and would
chase every butterfly that came in sight, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>tear his wings off, and then laugh because he
could not fly; she pinched the rabbits' ears
until they grew so wild they were almost
afraid of Daisy, and seemed to have no pleasure
except in making those about her very
uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Yes, Maud had one other pleasure&mdash;she
loved to sit beside the still pools in the wood,
that were like mirrors, and watch the reflection
of her handsome face.</p>

<p>But after this, she was sure to go home
peevish and discontented, telling her mother
and Daisy what a shame it was to live in
such a lonely place, and have no one admire
her beauty; and to be so poor, and depend on
the charity of "that hag," as she called the
dame.</p>

<p>Then she loved to tell Daisy what a common-looking
little thing <i>she</i> was, and how the
mark of those ugly spectacles was always on
her face, and every day it grew more homely
and serious, and as if she were a daughter of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>the dame. "As for myself," Maud would end,
"I am the child, I know, of some great man;
the dame has stolen me away from him, I feel
sure, and then thinks I ought to be grateful
because she brings me these clothes."</p>

<p>At this, Daisy would look up through her
spectacles, and say, meekly, "It doesn't matter
much who is our father here; for God, up in
heaven, is the Father of us all, and gives great
people their fine houses, just as he gives these
flowers to you and me; for mother told me so."</p>

<p>Then Maud would toss her head, and ask,
"What is mother but an old woodcutter's
wife, that has worked, perhaps, in my father's
kitchen?"</p>

<p>"God doesn't care where we have worked,
but how well our work is done," said Daisy.</p>

<p>"O, nonsense! Who ever saw God? I want
a father that can build me a fine house, all
carpeted, and lighted with chandeliers, and full
of servants, like the houses mother tells us
about sometimes."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>
<p>"Why, Maud, what is this world but a great
house that God has built for us? All creatures
are our servants; the sun and stars are its
chandeliers; the clouds are its beautiful window
frames; and this soft moss is the carpet.
Look, what dear little flowers grow among it,
and gaze up as if they were saying, 'Yes&mdash;God
made us all.'"</p>

<p>"Who wants a house that every one else
can enjoy as much as we, and a father that is
not ashamed to call every dirty beggar his
child?"</p>

<p>Daisy thought her home all the pleasanter
for this, and loved her heavenly Father more,
because he had room in his heart for even the
meanest creature; but she could not make her
sister feel as she did, nor try, as Daisy tried,
to be patient, and gentle, and happy.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV.</h3>
<h4>THE SPECTACLES.</h4>

<p>Ashamed as Maud was of her mother, she
found new cause for unhappiness, when, one
day, Susan died.</p>

<p>"Who is there, now," asked the beauty, "to
make my fine dresses, and keep them clean,
and to pet me, and praise my beauty, and carry
me to the fair sometimes, so that every one
may look at my face, and wish hers were
half so handsome?"</p>

<p>"Poor, dear mother, your hard work is done,"
said Daisy, in her gentle way, bending over the
dead form that Susan had left. "You will
never see the old dame's face again, nor hear
the wolves growl in the wood, nor tire yourself
with taking care of us."</p>

<p>The corpse's hands were hard and rough, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>they had grown so with working for her children;
and Daisy kissed them tenderly, and
filled them with fresh flowers, and bore her
mother's body far into the still wood, and
buried it under the same great tree that lay
still, like a tombstone, across Peter's grave.</p>

<p>Though Daisy was no longer a child, she
could not have done this without fairy help.
All the way, she felt as if other arms than
hers were bearing her mother's form, and as
if new strength were in her own when they
handled the heavy spade.</p>

<p>As Daisy worked there alone in the wood,&mdash;for
she could not see the fairy, who was
helping her,&mdash;the little birds sang sweet and
tender songs, as if they would comfort their
friend.</p>

<p>For Daisy had loved her mother dearly, and
remembered her loving, parental care, and
could not but be sorrowful at losing her, even
for a little while.</p>

<p>Yet she tried to calm her aching heart, be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>cause
Maud, she knew, would need all her care
now, and must be served, and entertained, and
comforted more carefully than ever, so that
she might not constantly miss her mother, and
spend her days in weeping over what could
not be helped.</p>

<p>The young girl did not think how much
more toil, and care, and unhappiness was coming
to herself; for it was always Daisy's way
to ask what she could do for others, and not
what others might do for her.</p>

<p>And, children, if you want your friends, and
God himself, to love you, depend upon it there
is no way so sure as this&mdash;to forget yourselves,
and think only whom you can serve.
It is hard, at first, but becomes a pleasure
soon, and as easy and natural as, perhaps, it
is now for you to be selfish.</p>

<p>You must not be discouraged at failing a
few times; for it takes a great deal of patience
to make us saints.</p>

<p>But every step we move in the right way,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>you know, is one step nearer to our home in
heaven&mdash;the grand and peaceful home that
Christ has promised us.</p>

<p>We left Daisy in the wood, with the birds
singing above her, as she finished her pious
work; perhaps, with finer ears, we might have
heard angels singing songs of joy above the
holy, patient heart that would not even grieve,
because another needed all its strength.</p>

<p>But the birds' songs ceased; they fluttered
with frightened cries, instead; the wind rose,
and the boughs began to dash about, and the
night came on earlier than usual. Daisy saw
there was to be another fearful storm; and
her first thought was of Maud, alone in the
lonely wood.</p>

<p>How she wished for wings, like the birds,
that she might fly home to her nest! But,
instead, she must plod her way among the underbrush,
which grew so thick in places, and
the wind so tangled together across the path,
that she went on slowly, hardly knowing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>whether she were going nearer home or deeper
into the wood.</p>

<p>"Silly girl, where are your spectacles?" said
a voice by Daisy's side; and the old woman
seized her arm, and dragged her over the
rough path, as she had done once before.</p>

<p>"There is no need of them, now I have
your lamp," said Daisy in a sad voice; for
she was thinking of dear faces that her eyes
would never rest upon again.</p>

<p>"That's as much as you know. But you
cannot cheat me, Daisy. Have my glasses been
of so little use that you put them in your
pocket, and choose rather to look through
tears?"</p>

<p>"I did not mean to cry; but how can any
one help it when&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know&mdash;I know; you needn't tell me
of your sorrows, but take out the spectacles."</p>

<p>So Daisy did as she was told, and never had
the glasses seemed so wonderful; for, besides that
now the old dame's lamp gave a clearer light,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>something made Daisy lift her eyes, and, instead
of two poor bodies lying asleep in the
storm, she saw a splendid city far, far up upon
the tops of the tallest trees, and Peter and
Susan walking there, hand in hand, and smiling
upon her as Peter had smiled in her dream.</p>

<p>"Well," said the shrill voice of the dame,
"will you give me back my glasses now, and
keep your tears?"</p>

<p>"O, no!" and Daisy seized the old woman's
withered hand, and turned to thank her; but
she was not there: one moment Daisy felt the
pressure of a gentle hand in hers, and then
the beautiful fairy floated from before her
sight, far up above the trees, and stood, at
last, with her father and mother. All three
were smiling upon her now, and pointing upwards
to the trees, whose leaves were broader
and more beautiful than any in the wood.</p>

<p>But the young girl stumbled, and fell among
the thorns, and seemed all at once to awake
from a dream; for, the dame's lamp gone, her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>path had grown narrow and dark again; and
she found it would not do to look any more
at the city of gold, until she should find her
own poor cabin in the wood.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XV.</h3>
<h4>THE FATHER'S HOUSE.</h4>

<p>At length Daisy knew that her home was
near; for, above all the howling of the storm,
she heard her sister's sobs and frightened cries.</p>

<p>Very tired she was, and cold, and drenched
with rain, and sad, besides, for she could not
enter the door without thinking of the burden
she had borne away from it last.</p>

<p>But, instead of rest and comforting words,
Maud ran to meet her with whining and bitter
reproaches, and called her cruel to stay so
long, and foolish to have gone at all, hard-hearted
to neglect her mother's child, and
would not listen to reason nor excuse, but
poured forth the wickedness of her heart in
harsh and untrue words, or else indulged her
selfish grief in passionate tears and cries.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>
<p>Alas! the wolves and snakes that Susan kept
away from the cabin had entered it now, and
our poor Daisy too often felt their fangs at
her sad heart.</p>

<p>She gave her sister no answering reproaches
back, and did not, as she well might, say that
it was Maud's own fault she had been left
alone; for she had refused, when Daisy asked
her help in making their mother's grave.</p>

<p>When we see people foolish and unreasonable,
like Maud, we must consider that it is
a kind of insanity; they don't know what
they are saying. Now, when crazy people
have their wild freaks, the only way to quiet
them is by gentleness; and we must treat
angry people just the same, until <i>their</i> freaks
pass.</p>

<p>You would not tease a poor crazy man, I
hope; and why, then, tease your brother or
sister when their senses leave them for a little
while?</p>

<p>As soon as Maud would listen, Daisy began
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>to tell about the beautiful city she saw through
her spectacles, and how the dreadful old dame
had changed to a graceful fairy, and floated
up above the trees.</p>

<p>But her sister interrupted her, to ask why
she had never told before of the wonderful
gift in her spectacles, and called her mean for
keeping them all to herself.</p>

<p>She knew very well that the reason was,
Daisy had never found any one to believe in
what she saw, and that even her mother laughed
at her for wearing such old things.</p>

<p>Maud snatched them eagerly now from Daisy's
hand, but said, at first, she could only see
the lightning and the rain, and then suddenly
dashed them on the ground, with a frightened
cry.</p>

<p>For she had seemed, all at once, to stand
out in a lonely wood, by night, and to look
through the ground, at her feet, and see as
plainly as by daylight the dead form of her
mother, with the rain drops, that pelted every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>where, dripping upon the flowers which Daisy
had put in her folded hands.</p>

<p>Maud would not tell this to her sister, but
said peevishly, "Your old glasses are good for
nothing, as I always thought; and you only
want me to wear them so as to spoil my
beauty, and make me as homely as you. Tell
me again about the place you saw our mother
in, though I don't believe a word of what you
say."</p>

<p>Daisy knew better, and answered, "It was
a more beautiful city than any we ever thought
about in the world. This earth seemed like
its cellar, it was so dull and cold here after
I had seen that glorious light; the trees looked
in it as if they were made of gold."</p>

<p>"O, you are always talking about light and
trees; tell me about the people and the houses."</p>

<p>"The houses were so bright, I cannot tell
you exactly how they looked; the foundations
of them were clear, dazzling stones, of every
color; even the streets were paved with glass;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>and the walls were gold, and the gates great
solid pearls!"</p>

<p>"What nonsense, Daisy! Didn't the shop-keeper
tell us, at the fair, that one little speck
of a pearl cost more than my new gown?
Now, what of the people?"</p>

<p>"You didn't look at the houses, after once
seeing them; they had such lovely faces, and
such a kind, gentle look, I could cry at only
thinking of them now."</p>

<p>"Don't cry till you've finished your story.
Were any of them handsomer than the rest?
And what kind of dresses did they wear?"</p>

<p>"Their clothes were made of light, I should
think; for they were softer than spider webs,
and kept changing their shape and color as
the people moved about."</p>

<p>"How could they?"</p>

<p>"Why, all the light poured from one place,
that I could not look into; and even the
heavenly people, when they turned towards it,
folded their wings before their faces."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>
<p>"That is where I should build my house."</p>

<p>"O, no, my sister; that is where our heavenly
Father has built his throne; and it is
the light from him that makes the whole city
splendid, without any sun or moon. You cannot
tell what a little, dark speck I felt before
God: I trembled, and did not know where to
turn, when one of the people came and took
my hand."</p>

<p>"How frightened I should have been! Did
he have wings?"</p>

<p>"I can't remember; but he moved&mdash;all in
the heavenly city move&mdash;more quickly and
more easily than birds. They want to be in
a place, and are there like a flash of light;
and they can see and hear so far, that the
beautiful man who spoke to me said he saw
me kiss our mother's hands, and put flowers in
them, and carry her into the wood."</p>

<p>"Did he say any thing about me?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;that some time you would love him
better than any one else. And he told me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>why the people's clothes kept changing: when
they went nearer our Father, their faces, and
every thing they wore, became more splendid
and lovely, but as they moved away from
him, grew darker and coarser; and yet, Maud,
the commonest of all the people there is
beautiful as our fairy, and wears as splendid
clothes."</p>

<p>"What was the man's name? I hope he was
not common, if I must love him."</p>

<p>"No, he was the greatest in heaven; all the
men and angels bowed to him, and they called
him Christ."</p>

<p>"O, I would give every thing to see him;
you never shall go through the wood alone,
Daisy, for fear he will come again when I'm
away."</p>

<p>"He could come to our house as well as to
the grave. And I'll tell you another strange
thing about the city, Maud: some of the roads,
you know, are glass, and some are gold; and
there is a beautiful river, like crystal, shaded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>with palm trees, and sweeping on till it is
lost in the great light."</p>

<p>"I don't see any thing wonderful in that, if
the rest of your story be true."</p>

<p>"I have not finished: these broad roads
ended in narrow paths; and from the river
trickled tiny streams, that somehow came down
over the golden walls of the city, and over the
clouds, and the tops of trees, into this very
earth we are standing on."</p>

<p>"O Daisy! are you sure? Could I find one
of the paths, and so climb up to heaven, and
find the beautiful Christ I am to love?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he told me so himself, and pointed to
all the people on earth that were in those
paths; and I saw a brightness about them,
and a calm look in their faces, such as God's
angels have. And then Christ told how all
who tasted of the streams grew strong; beautiful,
and glad; sick people, that stepped into
them, were healed; and those who washed in
the water were never unclean again."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>
<p>And Daisy did not tell, because she feared it
might make her sister envious and sad, that
the Beautiful One had kissed her forehead,
and said, "Daisy, you have picked many a
flower beside these streams, and they have
soothed your father's weariness, and healed
your mother's aching heart; and when you
come to live with me, and I place them all
on your head in a wreath that shall never
fade, no angel in heaven will wear a more
beautiful crown."</p>

<p>Daisy looked up at him then, and asked,
"But will you take them away from my
mother? And shall not Maud have some?
Only let me live near you, and give her the
crown."</p>

<p>Christ smiled, and then looked sad, and said,
"It will be long before your sister is willing
to walk in such straight, narrow paths, and
dwell beside such still waters, as she must
in order to find these flowers; but you will
always be pointing them out to her; and, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>the end, she will love me better than she loves
any one else. I would gladly help her, Daisy,
for your sake; but only they who love can
dwell with me."</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVI.</h3>
<h4>THE WATCHMAN.</h4>

<p>So tired was Daisy, after all the labor and
excitement of the day, that as soon as she had
finished her story she fell asleep. Maud tried
until she was tired to arouse her sister, and
make her talk some more; but Daisy, except
for her quiet breathing, was like one dead.</p>

<p>Maud could not sleep; she listened to the
howling of the storm, and then remembered
the grave she had seen through Daisy's spectacles,
out there in the night; and then her
sister's vision of the beautiful, shining city,
whose people were clothed in light, and thought
of the highest among them all, the King, who
waited for her love.</p>

<p>"He will not care for Daisy, with her wise
little face, when once he has seen mine," thought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>Maud. "I shall wear my finest garments, and
put on my most stately and haughtiest look,
to show him I am not like common people.
I hope he does not know that every thing I
have comes from that wretched old dame."</p>

<p>Here there sounded a rattling at the door
latch, as if some one were coming into the
cabin. Maud's heart beat loud and fast for
fright; she imagined that dreadful things were
about to happen, and scolded poor Daisy, as if
she could hear, for pretending to be asleep.</p>

<p>Then came quick flashes of lightning, that
made the room like noonday for one instant;
and then thunder in crashing peals, that sounded
more dreadful in the silent night; and then
a stillness, through which Maud could hear the
voices of the wolves, and the heavy, pelting
drops.</p>

<p>Sometimes she thought the river would swell,
and swell, till it flooded into the cabin, and
drowned them both; sometimes she thought the
lightning would kill her at a flash, or the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>wolves would break through the slender door,
and eat her up, or the wind would blow the
cabin down, and bury her.</p>

<p>Wasn't it strange that the thought never came
to her, as she lay there trembling, what a poor,
weak thing she was, and how good the fairy
had been to keep all mischief from her until now?</p>

<p>She did think of the fairy, at length, and
resolved to call her help, if it were possible.
She lighted a lamp, and held it so near Daisy's
eyes as almost to burn the lashes off; this she
found better than shaking or scolding, for Daisy
started up from her pleasant dreams, and asked
where she was and what was happening.</p>

<p>"That!" said Maud, as a still sharper flash
of lightning ran across the sky, and then thunder
so loud that it drowned Maud's angry
voice.</p>

<p>Daisy covered her face, for the lightning
almost blinded her, and then first found that
she had fallen asleep with the fairy spectacles on.</p>

<p>"Come, selfish girl," said Maud, "look through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>your old glasses; and if they are good for any
thing, you can find what has become of the
dame, and if she is still awake and watching
over us."</p>

<p>Then Daisy told how she had been once to
the old woman's cave; and if it were not for
leaving her sister alone, would go again to-night.</p>

<p>Maud would not listen to this at first, but
told Daisy that she was deceiving her, and only
wanted to creep off somewhere and sleep, and
leave her to be eaten by the wolves. As she
spoke, Daisy's face lighted all at once with the
beautiful smile which Peter saw, the day that
she was born.</p>

<p>"O Maud, listen, and you will not be afraid,"
she said in her gentle voice. "I seemed to
see, just now, the night, and the storm, and our
cabin, and myself asleep&mdash;all as if in a picture.
The lightning flashed and thunder rolled;
the wolves were creeping about the door, and
sniffing at the threshold, and the cabin rocked
in the wind like a cradle.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>
<p>"But just where you are standing, Maud, was
an angel bending over me, and shading my
eyes from the dazzle with her own white wings.
She had such a quiet, gentle face as I never
saw any where except in my vision of our
Father's house."</p>

<p>"Were her eyes black, or blue like mine?
I wonder if Christ ever saw her."</p>

<p>"I do not remember the color; but her eyes
were full of love, and pity, and tenderness; and
when I seemed to awake, and look up at her,
she pointed out into the night."</p>

<p>"And there, I suppose, you will pretend that
you saw something else very fine&mdash;as if I
should believe such foolish stories! But talk
on, for it keeps you awake."</p>

<p>"No, Maud, nothing seemed beautiful after
the angel's face; but I saw a strong city, with
walls, and towers on the walls, and with
watchmen walking to and fro to keep robbers
away. And I saw a great house, as large as
a hundred of ours, with heavy doors, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>bolts, and locks, and many servants&mdash;strong
men, sleeping in their beds, for it was night.</p>

<p>"And in one of the inmost rooms, where all
was rich and elegant, and the carpet was soft
as moss, and the muslin curtains hung like
clouds, lay a girl about my age, but a great
deal more beautiful, asleep."</p>

<p>"Was she handsomer than I?" interrupted
Maud.</p>

<p>"I had not time to ask myself; for, as I
looked, the door opened softly, and two thieves
crept in, and snatched the jewels that lay about
the room, and then, seeing a bracelet on her
white arm, went towards the bed.</p>

<p>"I was about to scream, when the fairy softly
put her hand before my mouth, and pointed
again.</p>

<p>"As soon as the thief touched her arm, the
girl awoke, and shrieked aloud; and, when
they could not quiet her cries, the men struck
at her with their sharp knives, and left her
dead.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>
<p>"Then the angel whispered, 'Daisy, there is
only one hand that can save; there is one eye
that watches, over rich and poor, the crowded
city and the lonely wood, alike. That eye is
God's; unless he keep the city, the watchman
walketh in vain.'</p>

<p>"So, Maud, the angel will take care of us,
if we only trust in her."</p>

<p>Maud's fears were quieted so far by Daisy's
words, that she urged her sister now to go
and seek the dame, and leave her there alone.</p>

<p>The truth was, Maud had a feeling that,
if poor little Daisy had an angel to watch
over her, she, who was so much more beautiful,
could not be left to perish. Perhaps, even
the glorious Christ would come; and if he
did, she would rather not have her sister in
the way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVII.</h3>
<h4>THE FAIRY'S CAVE.</h4>

<p>The old dame had built a fire in the corner
of her cave, and sat, alone, watching the
embers.</p>

<p>Presently she heard a sound unlike the storm&mdash;a
parting of the bushes outside, a crackling
of dry sticks upon the ground; and, all at
once, Daisy's bright face appeared, seeming to
bring a sunshine into the gloomy den.</p>

<p>Daisy was dripping with rain, and felt a
little afraid that the dame would scold her because
her feet made wet tracks on the floor.</p>

<p>But the fairy seemed in a merry mood to-night&mdash;perhaps
she was glad of some one to
keep her company. She laughed till the old
cave rang again, when her visitor told that she
had been frightened by the storm; for she said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>it was music in her ears, and ought to be in
the ears of every one.</p>

<p>So she drew a stool before the fire for Daisy,
and, while wringing the dampness from her
dress, asked what had become of the spectacles.</p>

<p>"O, they are safe enough," answered Daisy.
"I know now how much they are worth, and
what a splendid present you gave me, though
it seemed so poor. You are very good to us,
dame."</p>

<p>"Better than I seem&mdash;always better than I
seem," she muttered, looking into the fire still.
"Now, if you think so much of your glasses,
put them on."</p>

<p>Daisy wiped the water from them on a corner
of the fairy's dress, for her own was too
wet, and did as she was told.</p>

<p>And, down, down miles beneath the cave, she
saw fires burning, blazing, flashing, flaming about,
and filling the whole centre of the earth; beside
them the lightning was dull, and the old
dame's fire seemed hardly a spark.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>
<p>She saw whole acres of granite&mdash;the hard
stone that lay in pieces about the wood, half
covered with moss and violets; acres of this
were rolling and foaming like the river in a
storm, melted and boiling in the fiery flames.</p>

<p>"Why, in a few minutes, the cave itself, and
all the earth, will melt, and we shall be burned
up," said Daisy, alarmed.</p>

<p>"O, no," laughed the fairy. "The fire was
kindled thousands of years before you were
born; and the granite your violets grow upon
has boiled like this in its day; but we are
not burned yet, and shall not be. There's a
bridge over the fire."</p>

<p>And, surely enough, when Daisy looked again,
she saw great cold ribs of rock rising above
the flames and above the sea of boiling stone,
up and out, like arches on every side. Upon
this rock the earth was heaped, layer above
layer, until on its outside countries, and cities,
and great forests were planted, and fastened
together, it seemed, by rivers and seas.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>
<p>In the beds of rivers, in crevices of rock,
in depths of the earth, were hidden precious
stones and metals; and where the rocks rose
highest, they formed what we call mountains,
that buried their soaring heads in the sky,
and stretched along the earth for many hundred
miles.</p>

<p>"What can this rock be made of?" asked
Daisy. "Look!" and, to her wonder, she saw
that it was all little cells, crowded with insects
of different kinds. She asked the dame
how many there were in one piece of stone
which she picked up, and which was about an
inch square.</p>

<p>"About forty-one thousand millions of one
kind, and many more of another," she answered
carelessly.</p>

<p>"You could not make Maud believe that,"
thought Daisy; and the dame, as if seeing into
her mind, continued,&mdash;</p>

<p>"But it is only the one little world we live
in which you have seen thus far: look above."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>
<p>The roof of the cave seemed gone; and
Daisy beheld the stars, not far off and still,
as they had always seemed, but close about
her, whirling, waltzing, chasing each other in
circles, with such tremendous speed that it made
one dizzy to watch.</p>

<p>And they were no longer little points of
light, but worlds like ours&mdash;many of them
larger than our earth, which was whirling too,
and seemed so small that Daisy hardly noticed
it amidst the beaming suns.</p>

<p>There were no handles, no fastenings, no
beams, or ropes, or anchors to those flying
worlds, that dashed along at such mad speed;
she wondered they did not strike against each
other, and shatter, and fall.</p>

<p>"O, no," said the dame; "the Hand which
made these worlds can keep them in their
places. But how many stars do you suppose
there are?"</p>

<p>"O, I could not count them in a week."</p>

<p>"No, nor in a lifetime. It takes more than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>that to count one million; and there are more
than twenty million worlds."</p>

<p>"There will be no use in telling that to
Maud," thought Daisy; "she'll never believe me."</p>

<p>And again the fairy saw into her heart, and
answered, "Only the pure in heart can see
God, and believe in him. Maud thinks there
is no truth, because her weak mind cannot
grasp it.</p>

<p>"Now, Daisy, think that all these worlds
are God's&mdash;made, and watched, and loved by
him. You see in many of them mountains
such as the piece of stone you looked into;
you see rivers, earth, and sky; and I tell you
the truth when I say, that all of these are
crowded, fuller than you can dream, with creatures
He has made. And cannot He who
made the lightning govern it? So, do not
fear the howling of the storm again; it is
your Father's voice."</p>

<p>"How great he is! I am afraid of him!"
said Daisy.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>
<p>"You may well be afraid to offend him, but
only that; for God is a gentle, loving Father.
He feels when the tiniest insect in this stone
is hurt; and the same mighty Hand that guides
the stars, and roofs over the fires that might
burn up our earth,&mdash;the same Hand led you
through the storm to-night, or, Daisy, you would
not have found my cave."</p>

<p>The dame's last words reminded Daisy that
she had left her sister alone; and though Maud
had surprised her by saying that she need not
hurry back, Maud might have changed her
mind, and complain of the very thing she
asked an hour before.</p>

<p>She flew home, therefore&mdash;falling many a
time, and wounding her hands with the sharp
sticks in her path. Great trees were torn up
by the roots, and came crashing down, in the
dark, scattering earth and pebbles far and
wide; but Daisy walked among them all
unharmed, and was not even frightened; for
she knew some kind hand must be guiding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>her, and thought of the Watchman who never
sleeps.</p>

<p>Reaching the cabin, she found Maud in a
quiet slumber; and, lying down beside her,
Daisy was soon dreaming over again all she
had seen through the spectacles.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVIII.</h3>
<h4>DAISY ALONE.</h4>

<p>The sisters lived together comfortably enough
in the wood, for the old dame still supplied
their wants; and Daisy grew so accustomed to
Maud's complaints and reproaches, that she did
not mind them so much as at first.</p>

<p>Then it was such a joy when, sometimes,
Maud would be pleased and satisfied, and speak
a kind word or two, that her sister forgot all
the rest.</p>

<p>The fairy had been in the habit, after Susan's
death, of taking Maud to the fair sometimes,
where she could see the people, and
choose handsome gowns for herself, and hear
what was going on in the world.</p>

<p>Meantime Daisy would remain at home, cleaning
the house and washing Maud's dresses, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>baking some nice thing for her to eat when
she should come home tired from the fair.</p>

<p>You may think this hard for Daisy; but you
are mistaken, this time, for she was never so
merry as when working thus alone. There
was no one to meddle and complain when she
was trying to do her best. Let Maud depart,
and all was peace in Daisy's home.</p>

<p>Maud seemed to think that Daisy was made
for her servant; and when she wished to enjoy
herself alone, or to do some kind deed,&mdash;for
other people lived, now, in the neighborhood
of the cabin,&mdash;her sister would always interfere,
and complain and whine so grievously
that Daisy yielded to her.</p>

<p>But Maud away, and her work all finished
in the house, Daisy would clap on her spectacles,
and then such a wonderful world as
stretched around her! Nothing was common,
or mean, or dead; all things were full of
beauty and surprise, when she looked into them.</p>

<p>The insects that stung Maud, and made her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>so impatient, would settle quietly on Daisy's
hand, and let her find out how their gauzy, glittering
wings were made, and see all the strange
machinery by which they could rise and fly,
and the little beating hearts and busy heads
they had.</p>

<p>Then they would go slowly circling to their
homes; and Daisy would softly follow, and find
how they lived, and what they ate, and what
became of them in winter time, and all about
their young.</p>

<p>The birds, meantime, would come and sing
to her about their joy, their young, their fairy
nests, their homes among the shady summer
leaves; the poorest worm, the ugliest spider,
had something in him curious and beautiful.</p>

<p>Then she would study the plants and trees,
see the sap rising out of the ground, and
slowly creeping into every branch and leaf, and
the little buds come forth, and swell, and
burst, at length, into lovely flowers.</p>

<p>She would sit upon the mossy rocks, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>think how far down under the earth they had
been, and how full they might be of living
creatures now; and then bending over the
violets that had grown in their crevices, would
count their tiny veins, and find how air and
sunshine had mixed with the sap to color and
perfume them.</p>

<p>All these works of his hands made Daisy
feel how near the great God was to her, and
that she could never go where he had not
been before, and where his eye would not follow
her.</p>

<p>And then, amidst her troubles and toils, she
had but to think of the beautiful city above,
where Peter and Susan were waiting for her,
where the spirits clothed in light would be
her teachers and friends, and she would see
as far, perhaps, as they, and learn more a thousand
times than even her wonderful spectacles
could teach her now.</p>

<p>But, one day, the dame took a fancy in her
head that she was too old to go to the fair
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>again, and, in future, Daisy must go instead,
and take care of Maud.</p>

<p>This pleased neither of the sisters; for Daisy
now must lose her only hours of quiet; and
Maud, instead of the old crone who had passed
for her servant, must appear with the shabby
little Daisy, of whose meek, serious face, and
country manners, she was very much ashamed.</p>

<p>Then there was the mark of the spectacles
to attract attention, and make every one ask
who it could be that had such a wise look
on a face so young.</p>

<p>But the two sisters started, one morning,
for the fair, on the selfsame road on which
Peter had met his wife, and along which he
had led her home, to make his cabin such a
happy place.</p>

<p>It was not so bad for Maud to have Daisy
with her as she had feared; for the good
natured sister carried all her parcels, found
out cool springs where they could drink, and
pleasant spots where they could sit in the cool
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>grass and rest sometimes, instead of hurrying
on through the dust, as the dame had always
done.</p>

<p>Then Daisy had a cheerful heart, and was
pleased with every thing she met, and so full
of her stories and cheerful songs, that the way
seemed not half so long to Maud as when she
went with the dame.</p>

<p>Ah, but Maud didn't think how much shorter
and brighter her sister's path through life
would have been had <i>she</i>, instead of her selfish
temper, a good and gentle heart like that
which was cheering her now.</p>

<p>Daisy took her spectacles along, you may
be sure; and besides that she saw through
them many a flower, and bird, and stone, and
countless other things to which her sister was
as good as blind, Maud found them very useful
at the fair.</p>

<p>For the glasses showed things now exactly
as they were&mdash;in the rich silk, rough places
or cotton threads; calicoes, gay enough to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
naked eye, through these looked faded and
shabby. Was any thing shopworn, moth eaten,
or out of fashion, the spectacles told it as
plainly as if they had spoken aloud.</p>

<p>And just so, seen through these magical
glasses, the people changed. A man with a
smiling face and pleasant words would appear
dishonest and cunning, when Daisy put on her
spectacles. A maiden with a proud and beautiful
face looked humbled, all at once, and sad,
and dying of a broken heart. People that
walked about in splendid clothes, and looked
down on the others, seemed suddenly poor beggars,
hiding beneath their garments as if they
were a mask.</p>

<p>The dame would never carry bundles for
Maud, nor allow herself to be hurried or
contradicted in any way; but Daisy bore all
the burdens of her own accord, and yielded
to Maud's caprices, however foolish they might
be, if they troubled no one except herself.</p>

<p>But on their way home, something occurred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
in which Daisy resolved to have her own way;
and Maud was so angry that she would not
walk with her sister, and hurrying on, left
her far behind.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIX.</h3>
<h4>THE QUARREL.</h4>

<p>It was the old dame that caused the sisters'
quarrel. A few miles from the cabin she appeared,
creeping through the dusty road, with
a bundle of sticks three times as big as herself
on her head.</p>

<p>"Pretty well!" exclaimed Maud. "The old
creature could not find strength enough to walk
a little way with me; but she can pick up
sticks all day for herself, and carry home more
than I could even lift."</p>

<p>The dame made no reply; perhaps she did
not hear the beauty's words; but Maud was
so vexed that she brushed roughly past, and
upset all her sticks, and the poor old dame in
the midst of them.</p>

<p>The fairy lifted her wrinkled arm, which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
covered with bleeding scratches, and shook her
finger angrily at Maud, who only laughed, and
said, "It is good enough for you; take care,
next time, how you stand in my way. I am
the one to be angry, after you've scattered
your sharp old sticks all over the road to
fray my new silk stockings. Come, Daisy,
make a path for me through them."</p>

<p>Daisy helped the dame to her feet again,
and wiped away the dust and blood, and
bound the arm up with her own handkerchief,
and then began patiently to pick up all the
sticks, and fasten them in a bundle.</p>

<p>She did this while Maud and the fairy were
quarrelling and reproaching each other. We
could often make up for a fault or accident
in the time which we spend mourning over it
and deciding whose was the fault.</p>

<p>Maud, in her heart, was not sorry for what
her sister had now done, because she feared
the fairy, and knew, if she went too far in
offending her, that she might never appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
again; and then Miss Maud would eat coarse
food, and wear shabby clothes, like her sister
Daisy.</p>

<p>Still she pretended to be angry, and scolded
Daisy well for undoing what she had done,
and comforting the old woman when she chose
to punish her.</p>

<p>Yet more vexed was she when Daisy took
the sticks on her own head; for the dame
seemed tired and faint, and trembled like a
leaf from the fright and pain of her fall.</p>

<p>Maud drew herself up haughtily, and asked
if she was expected to walk in a public road
in company with a lame old hag and a fagot
girl. Her eyes flashed, and the color glowed
in her delicate cheeks, as she spoke; Daisy
thought she had never seen her sister look so
beautiful, and even took out the glasses that
she might look more closely at the handsome
face.</p>

<p>Alas, what a change! Serpents seemed coiling
and hissing about Maud's breast; her eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
were like the eyes of a wolf; the color on
her cheeks made Daisy think of the fires she
had seen burning so far down in the centre
of the earth; and the ivory whiteness of her
forehead was the dead white of a corpse.</p>

<p>It was not strange that, Maud's beauty gone,
her sister grew less submissive; for Daisy, even
with her spectacles, had found nothing except
beauty to love in her sister. She thought a
lovely heart must be hidden somewhere underneath
the lovely face.</p>

<p>But now she had looked past the outside,
and all was deformed and dreadful.</p>

<p>"I should like to know if you mean to answer,"
said Maud pettishly; "I told you either
to throw down the sticks, or else I would walk
home alone."</p>

<p>"I must help the poor dame; and as for
our walk, we both know the way," was Daisy's
quiet answer.</p>

<p>So they parted; and Daisy began to cheer
the dame, who groaned dreadfully, by telling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
of all the fine things at the fair, and the use
she had made of her spectacles, and how grateful
she must always be for such a wondrous gift.</p>

<p>It pleased the dame to have her glasses
praised; and so she forgot to limp and grumble
about her wounds, and walked on gayly
enough by Daisy's side, telling sometimes the
wisest, and sometimes the drollest, stories she
had ever heard.</p>

<p>But their mirth was interrupted by the sound
of sobs; and Daisy's quick eyes discovered, sitting
among the bushes by the way, a little
girl, all rags and dust, crying as if her heart
would break.</p>

<p>"Never mind her; she will get over it soon
enough," said the dame.</p>

<p>"I wonder how you would have liked it,
had I said that about you, an hour ago,"
thought Daisy, but made no reply, except to
turn and ask the child what she could do
for her.</p>

<p>"O, give me food, for I am starved, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
clothes, for I am cold, and take me with you,
for I am so lonely," sobbed the child.</p>

<p>"Then don't cry any more, but take my
hand; and here are some wild grapes I picked
just now&mdash;taste how fresh and sweet they
are."</p>

<p>The little girl laughed for joy, with the tears
still glistening on her face, and soon leaving
Daisy's hand, skipped about her, flying hither
and thither like a butterfly, filling her hands
with flowers, and then coming back, to look
up curiously in the strange old face of the
dame.</p>

<p>"You are a good soul, after all," said the
fairy, when Daisy returned to her side. "See
how happy you have made that little wretch!"</p>

<p>"Yes, and how easily, too! O, why do not
all people find out what a cheap comfort it is
to help each other? I think, if they only knew
this, that every one would grow kind and full
of charity."</p>

<p>Daisy did not dream that the child listened,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
or would understand what she was saying; but
the little girl, tears springing into her eyes
again, answered softly, "O, no, not all."</p>

<p>"Why, have you found so many wicked people,
my poor child?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps they are not wicked; but they
are not kind;" and the girl's voice grew sadder.
"Some time before you came, a beautiful
lady passed; she was not dressed like you,
but a hundred times handsomer; and I thought
she would have ever so much to give away;
so I asked her for a penny to buy bread."</p>

<p>"And did she give you one?" asked Daisy,
who saw that the lady must have been her
sister Maud.</p>

<p>"Not she; she called me names, and pushed
me away so roughly that I fell into a bunch
of nettles; and they stung till it seemed as
if bees were eating me up. Look there!"</p>

<p>So she held up her poor little arms, that
were pinched with poverty, as the dame's with
age; they were mottled, white and red or pur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>ple,
with the nettle stings; and only looking
at them made her cry again.</p>

<p>But Daisy comforted her. "There, I wouldn't
mind; she did not mean to hurt you. And,
besides, you must blame me; for I offended
her, and made her cross. She is my sister."</p>

<p>"O, dear, then I don't want to go home and
live with you; let me go back and die, if I must.
That lady would beat me, and pull my hair,
I know. When you met me, I was not crying
for hunger, though I was so hungry, nor for
cold, though my clothes were all worn out,
but because she was so unkind. Don't make
me live with her."</p>

<p>Here the fairy drew the little girl towards
her, and whispered, "Daisy has to live with her,
and be fretted at and worked hard all the time;
if you go, Maud will have another to torment,
and will leave her sister in peace sometimes."</p>

<p>Then the tears were dried at once; and the
child, taking Daisy's hand, said firmly, "Wherever
you lead me I will go."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>Daisy never knew what made her change her
mind, for she had not heard the fairy's whisper;
but angels in heaven knew it, and saw
how, at that moment, the child unconsciously
stepped into one of the golden paths that lead
to the beautiful city on high.</p>

<p>For no good deed, no good thought or intention
even, is lost. Few, perhaps, behold
them here; but hosts of the heavenly people
may always be looking on.</p>

<p>And even if they were not, it is better to
be good and kind: the good deed brings its
own reward; it makes our hearts peaceful; it
makes us respect ourselves, so that we can look
serenely in the face of every one, and, if they
blame us, answer, "I have done the best I
could."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XX.</h3>
<h4>TWILIGHT.</h4>

<p>When Maud had gone far enough to lose
sight of Daisy and the dame, she slackened her
pace, and looked about to see how beautiful
the path had grown.</p>

<p>The trees met in green arches above her
head; the road side was sprinkled with lovely
flowers, fragrant in the evening air; and the
breeze, stirring freshly, gave motion and a
sweet, low sound to every thing. Insects were
chirping merrily, and stars began to twinkle
through the boughs.</p>

<p>Even Maud did not feel lonely; she had
much to remember about the fair&mdash;all her
purchases, all the compliments she had heard
paid to her beauty, all Daisy's usefulness, and
how sure she would be to make her go again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>But the scene about her grew every moment
quieter and more beautiful; so that, leaving
her worldly thoughts, a solemn feeling came
over Maud, and she began to think of the
still more beautiful place which was some time
to be her home,&mdash;</p>

<p>And then of that Glorious One whom she
was to love; mean and coarse seemed her
earthly lovers when she thought of him, and
their compliments vulgar and idle beside his
gracious words.</p>

<p>"Ah, if I could but see this Christ once,"
thought Maud, "so that I might know what
would please him, and could always remember
him just as he really is! It is strange that
he does not come when he must know how I
am longing to behold his face."</p>

<p>And, in truth, Maud had never for an hour
forgotten her sister's vision, but was constantly
thinking what more she could do to make herself
attractive when the Beautiful One should
come.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>She would not go out at noon, for fear of
tanning her complexion; she hardly ate enough
to live, because of a fancy that angels have
very poor appetites; she gave up the sweet
smile which she had preserved with so much
care, and looked serious, and even sad. And
the foolish girl made it an excuse for not
doing her share of the household work, that
she could not go to heaven with the stains of
labor on her hands.</p>

<p>"What more can he require of me?" thought
Maud. "Let him but say, and I will do any
thing to serve this greatest of all the angels&mdash;will
die&mdash;will be his slave!"</p>

<p>In the twilight, Maud saw, all at once, beside
her a being more beautiful than she had
even thought her Christ. He was thin and
pale; he looked tired, and there were drops
of blood on his forehead and tears in his eyes.</p>

<p>Yet was there something noble and good
about him, that seemed grander than all the
beauty of this earth, and melted the heart of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
the haughty Maud; so that she asked him to
come to her cabin for food, and promised to
make the old dame give him clothes.</p>

<p>He shook his head, and answered, "I have
come to you before, naked, and hungry, and
tired, and sad; but you drove me away."</p>

<p>"O, no, you are mistaken," said Maud; "I
never saw you in my life before."</p>

<p>"When you refused food and shelter to the
poor, old, and wretched, you were starving and
freezing me."</p>

<p>"How could I know that?" said Maud, a
little peevishly. "But, come, take my hand, and
I will lead you where there is shelter and food."</p>

<p>He drew back from the hand she offered.
"I cannot touch these fingers; wicked words
are written over them."</p>

<p>"No such thing!" said Maud, thoroughly
vexed. "There is not a man at the fair but
would be proud to take my hand. Read the
wicked words, if you can."</p>

<p>"Waste, weakness, indolence, selfishness, scorn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
vanity," he read, as if the hand were a book
spread out before him.</p>

<p>And then the beautiful being disappeared;
and Maud, never dreaming that she had spoken
with <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, and hearing her sister's voice not
far behind, hurried on quickly, so as to be in
the cabin first.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXI.</h3>
<h4>THE FAIRY LETTERS.</h4>

<p>Maud was so tired of being alone, and so
anxious, besides, to ask if Daisy had seen the
stranger who disappeared from her, that she
ran good naturedly enough to the door, to
welcome her sister.</p>

<p>But when she saw the dame's wretched old
face, and the little beggar whom she had thrust
away so scornfully, and Daisy herself bending
under the heavy load of sticks, Maud's wrath
came back again.</p>

<p>"Here I shall have to wait an hour for my
supper," she complained, "because you chose
to lag behind, and tire yourself with bringing
burdens for other folks. I should like to know
where you will put your precious friends: not
in <i>our</i> house&mdash;be very sure of that."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>But the dame quickly silenced her by asking,
"Who has fed, and clothed, and taken care
of you and all your kith and kin? Who
gave you the gown on your back and the
beauty in your cheeks? And when you found
your sister lying half dead by the roadside,&mdash;as
you would have been but for my care,&mdash;what
were you willing to do for her? O
Maud, for shame!"</p>

<p>"She is no sister of mine," answered Maud,
making way; however, as she spoke, for the
beggar to enter her door.</p>

<p>"Ask Daisy," was the dame's reply.</p>

<p>"O Maud, I was so sorry that you left us,"
Daisy said; "for the beautiful man I saw in
heaven, whom you are to love, came and spoke
to me, with a look and words I can never
forget in all my life."</p>

<p>"Where was it?" asked the sister eagerly.</p>

<p>"In that part of the road which our father
used to call the Church, because the trees made
such grand arches overhead, and it was so
still and holy, with the stars looking through
the boughs. You remember the elm, with the
grape vine climbing up among its boughs, and
hanging full of fruit: I met him there."</p>

<p>"But he could not be half so beautiful as
the man I saw in that very place," boasted
Maud. "I talked with him a while; then I
suppose he heard you coming, for he went away."</p>

<p>The old dame's bright, sharp eyes were fixed
upon her; and Maud cast her own eyes down
in shame, as Daisy continued,&mdash;</p>

<p>"The dame's bundle of wood was very heavy,
and this little girl dragged so upon my skirts
as we toiled on, that I knew she must be
tired. I was feeling glad that I happened to
meet them, because I am both young and
strong, you know, and used to work, when, as
I told you, Christ appeared, standing beneath
the elm."</p>

<p><a name="Page_139b" id="Page_139b"></a></p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/image04_chap21.jpg" width="430" height="545" alt="AND HE LOOKED INTO MY FACE." title="" /><br />
<span class="smcap">and he looked into my face.</span>
</div>

<p>"How ashamed you must have felt! I suppose
he thought you the old dame's daughter,
or a beggar, perhaps. I'm glad you did not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>bring him to our cabin; how it would look
beside his palace in the golden city above!
What did he say to you?"</p>

<p>"'Blessed, O Daisy, are the merciful,' he
said; I was hungry, and you gave me food;
thirsty, and you gave me drink. I was sad,
and you cheered me; tired, and I rested on
your arm.'</p>

<p>"'O, no,' I answered, 'you must be thinking
of some one else. I never saw you before, except
in my vision once.'</p>

<p>"He took my hand, and looked into my
face with such a gentle smile that I did not
feel afraid, and pointed at the wood: 'This
burden was not the old dame's, but mine; the
blood you wiped away was mine; when you
fed and comforted this little one, you were
feeding and comforting me. You never can
tell how much good you are doing, Daisy;
poor girl as you are, you may give joy to my
Father's angels. Look through your spectacles.'</p>

<p>"So I looked, and there sat the poor little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
beggar, (see, she has fallen asleep from weariness!)
moaning and sobbing in the grass, as
when we found her first; and an angel stood
beside her, weeping, too."</p>

<p>"An angel beside <i>her</i>?" interrupted Maud.</p>

<p>"Yes, a beautiful angel, with the calm, holy
look which they all wear in heaven, but I never
saw upon this earth; he wept because she had
no friend; and, just then, I was so fortunate
as to come past, and, not seeing the angel, I
asked her to take my hand, and run along
beside me.</p>

<p>"But now I saw that, when the child began
to smile, the angel also smiled, and lifted his
white wings and flew&mdash;O, faster than lightning&mdash;over
the tree tops, and past the clouds;
and the sky parted where he went, until I saw
him stand before the throne, in the wonderful
city above.</p>

<p>"And Christ said, 'He stands there always,
watching her, unless she needs him here; and
when her earthly life is over, he will lead her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
back, to dwell in my Father's house. For the
great God is her Father, and yours, and
mine; she is my sister: should I not feel her
grief?'"</p>

<p>Maud's heart fell, for she felt that the being
whom she had met must also have been Christ,
and asked Daisy if he looked sad and tired,
and had wounds in his hands.</p>

<p>"O, no&mdash;what could tire him, Maud? He
looked strong, and noble, and glad, and seemed,
among the dark trees, like a shining light."</p>

<p>"Alas! then it was I who tired him, and
made him sorrowful," thought Maud; then said,
aloud, "But, Daisy, are you sure he took your
hand? See, it is smeared with the old dame's
blood, and soiled with tears you wiped from
the beggar's face, and stained and roughened
with hard work: are you sure he touched it?"</p>

<p>"The whole was so strange, that I dare not
be sure whether any part of it was real," replied
Daisy, who was so modest that she did
not wish to tell all Christ had said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>I</i> am sure, then," outspoke the dame. "He
took her hand, and&mdash;listen to me, Maud!&mdash;he
said, 'This blood, these tears, these labor
stains, will be the brightest jewels you can
wear in heaven; have courage, and be patient,
Daisy&mdash;for beautiful words are written here,
that never will fade away.'"</p>

<p>And when Maud asked what they were, the
dame replied sharply, "Exactly the opposite of
words that are written on somebody's fine
hands: self-sacrifice, and generosity, and faith,
and earnestness, and love. Such words as these
make Daisy's rough hands beautiful."</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXII.</h3>
<h4>THE FACE AND THE HEART.</h4>

<p>"Can I give up my beautiful face, and become
a poor little drudge, like Daisy?" asked
Maud of herself. "No, it's a great deal too
much trouble. I can find plenty of friends at
the fair; and so I will forget the sad, sweet
face that has haunted me all these months."</p>

<p>So Maud never told that she had looked
upon Christ; though every time Daisy spoke
of him, she felt it could be no other.</p>

<p>The winter came on; and the report of
Maud's beauty had spread so far, that she was
invited to balls in the neighboring towns; and
she no longer walked, for people sent their
elegant carriages for her.</p>

<p>The dame took care that she should have
dresses and jewels in abundance; and Daisy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
could not but feel proud when she saw her sister
look like such a splendid lady; though
sometimes she would be frightened by seeing
the eyes of a live snake glittering among
Maud's diamonds, and something that seemed
like the teeth of a wolf glistening among her
pearls.</p>

<p>The beauty had many lovers, but she found
some fault with each; until, one day, the handsomest
and gayest man in all the country round
asked her to marry him.</p>

<p>She refused, at first, because he had not quite
so much money as the others; but when she
saw how many ladies were in love with him,
Maud felt it would be a fine thing to humble
them, and show her own power. The old dame
could give them money enough; and so she
changed her mind, and began to make ready
for her wedding.</p>

<p>Then you should have seen the splendid
things that the old dame brought, day after
day, and poured on the cabin floor&mdash;velvets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
and heavy brocades, gay ribbons and silks, and
costly laces; as for the pearls and diamonds,
you would think she had found them by handfuls
in the river bed, there were so many.</p>

<p>Meantime Daisy had come across a very different
jewel, though I am not sure but it was
worth a cabin full of such as Maud's.</p>

<p>Once she was walking with the little beggar
girl, whom Daisy called her own child now,
and named Susan, after her mother; before
them, climbing the hill side, was a man in a
coarse blue frock, who seemed like a herdsman.</p>

<p>He was driving his cows, and turning back
to look for a stray one, Susan chanced to see
his face; she broke from Daisy, and with a
cry of joy, ran into the herdsman's arms.</p>

<p>His name was Joseph; and Daisy learned
that, when the little girl's mother was sick,
Joseph had brought her food, and taken the
kindest care of her; but his master sent him
to buy some cows in a distant town, and before
he reached home again, Susan's mother did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
not need any more charity, and the poor child
herself was cast out into the streets.</p>

<p>They sat on the grass beside Joseph; and
Daisy found that, for all his coarse dress, he
loved beautiful things as well as herself, and
had sat there, day after day, watching the river
and sky, and finding out the secrets of the
birds, seeing the insects gather in their stores,
and the rabbits burrow, and listening to the
whisper of the leaves.</p>

<p>And, in cold winter nights, he had watched
the stars moving on in their silent paths, so
far above his head, and fancied he could find
pictures and letters among them, and that they
beckoned, and seemed to promise, if he would
only try, he might come and live with them.</p>

<p>Then, out of some young shoots of elder,
Joseph had made a flute; and Daisy was enchanted
when he played on this, for, besides
that she had never heard a musical instrument
before, he seemed to bring every thing she
loved around her in his wonderful tunes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>She could almost see the dark pine tops
gilded with morning light, and the cabin nestling
under them; and then the song of a bird,
and of many birds, trilled out from amidst the
boughs, and the little leaves on the birch
trees trembled as with joy, and her rabbits
darted through the shade.</p>

<p>Again, she saw the wide river rolling on, the
sky reflected in it, and the flowers on its banks
just lifting their sweet faces to the sun, and
every thing was wet with dew, and fresh, and
silent.</p>

<p>And then he played what was like a storm,
with lightning, and huge trees crashing down,
and the old dame seated before her fire in the
cave, and Daisy herself creeping alone through
the dark, tired, and drenched with rain.</p>

<p>Daisy told her new friend that she lived in
the wood, and what a beautiful sister she had
at home, and how she wished that Maud could
hear his music.</p>

<p>But Joseph seemed contented to play for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
her, and could not leave his cows, he said, to
look upon a handsome face; he did not care
so much for bright eyes and pretty lips as for
goodness and gentleness, that would make the
ugliest face look beautiful to him.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIII.</h3>
<h4>JOSEPH.</h4>

<p>What with Joseph's music, and all he had
to say to them, Daisy and Susan sat for hours
on the hill side, and promised, at parting, to
come very soon again.</p>

<p>But they found Maud ready, as usual, to
spoil all their pleasure, by fretting because they
had left her alone, and had not come earlier,
and a hundred other foolish things.</p>

<p>She wouldn't hear a word about the music,
but asked her sister if she was not ashamed to
talk with a cow boy, and declared that neither
she nor Susan should go to the hill again.</p>

<p>But it was no strange thing for Maud to
change her mind; so, one day, she told Daisy
she had dreamed about Joseph's music, and must
hear it, and they would all go that very afternoon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>Daisy was glad, you may be sure; but she
had great trouble with her sister on the way,
for Maud would shriek at an earth worm, and
start at a fly, and was afraid of bats, and
snakes, and owls, and more other things than
Daisy ever thought of.</p>

<p>Then the sharp sticks cut through her satin
boots; and when she sat a while to rest, the
crickets ate great holes in her new silk gown,
and mosquitos kept buzzing about her, and little
worms dropped down sometimes from the boughs.</p>

<p>When any of these things happened, of course
poor Daisy had to be scolded, as if it were
her fault. If a shadow moved, or a bird flew
quickly past, or a bee buzzed by,&mdash;thinking
of any one except Miss Maud,&mdash;the beauty
would fancy that a tiger or rattlesnake was
making ready to spring at her, and suffered a
great deal more from fright than she would
from pain if the creatures she dreaded had
really been near, and she had allowed them
quietly to eat her up.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>When, after all this trouble, she found that
Joseph wore a coarse blue frock, and did not
oil his curly hair, and hardly looked at her,
while he was overjoyed at seeing Daisy again,
Maud began to pout, and say she must go home.</p>

<p>But Joseph brought a kind of harp he had
made from reeds and corn stalks; and when
he began to play, Maud started, for it was as
if she stood under the arching trees again,
and the Beautiful Being stood beside her, with
his sad eyes, saying, "O Maud, when you despise
my little ones, you are despising me."</p>

<p>She thought it must only be a kind of
waking dream, however, and tossing her head,
asked Joseph if he could play any opera airs,
and where he bought his harp, and who his
teacher could have been.</p>

<p>"The trees, and river, and birds, the morning
wind and midnight sky, sorrow, and joy,
and hope have been my teachers," he answered
gravely.</p>

<p>"They're an old-fashioned set, then," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
Maud. "We haven't had any of the tunes you
play at our balls this year; and you must find
more modern teachers, or else be content to
take care of your cows."</p>

<p>Joseph heard not her sneers; he was talking
with Daisy; and every thing he said seemed so
noble, and wise, and pure, so unlike the words
of Maud or of the fretful dame, that Daisy
could not help loving him with all her heart.</p>

<p>The more she thought of Joseph the less she
said of him to Maud; but whenever her sister
was away, they were sure to meet; and the
herdsman grew as fond of Daisy as she was
of him.</p>

<p>In the long winter evenings, when Maud was
away at her balls, she little dreamed what
pleasant times Daisy had at home. When
floating about in the dance, to the sound of
gay, inspiring music, she thought of her sister
only to pity her, and did not know that she
was listening to sweeter music from Joseph's
humble harp of reeds.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>We often pity people who are a great deal
better off than ourselves, forgetting that what
seems fine to us may be tedious enough to them.</p>

<p>Then it was such a new thing for Daisy to
have any one think of <i>her</i> comfort, and plan
pleasant surprises for her, and even admire her
serious face, and&mdash;best of all&mdash;appreciate her
spectacles.</p>

<p>As soon as Joseph came, he wanted her to
put them on, and tell him about a hundred
things which he had looked at only with his
naked eyes. Daisy found so often that he had
seen rightly and clearly, and had in humblest
paths picked up most lovely things, and every
where found what was best, she told him that
he must have borrowed the old dame's lantern.</p>

<p>But Joseph said, no, he had only taken care
that the lantern in his own breast should be
free from dust and stains; while that burned
clearly, there was no use in borrowing another's
light.</p>

<p>Maud's lover took her to dances and sleigh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
rides, and gave her jewels and confectionery;
Daisy's lover took her to see the old sick
mother he supported, and to look at his cows
in their neat barn, and brought her a new
apron sometimes from the fair, or a bag of
chestnuts which he had picked up in the fall.</p>

<p>But Joseph gave the love of a fresh, honest
heart; and Daisy thought this better than all
her sister's bright stones and sugar plums.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIV.</h3>
<h4>THE FRESHET.</h4>

<p>The spring came; and Maud's wedding day
was so near that she and Daisy went to the
town every week to make purchases.</p>

<p>Now, the river which they were obliged to
cross always overflowed its banks in spring.
Although, in summer, Daisy had often walked
across it, by stepping from stone to stone in
the rough bed, it had risen now to a height
of many feet.</p>

<p>Then, blocks of ice came down from the mountain
streams above, and swept along bridges,
and hay ricks, and drift wood with them, just
as happened once, you may remember, when
Susan was alive.</p>

<p>A new bridge had been built; but it jarred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
frightfully when the heaped blocks of ice came
down, or some great tree was dashed against
it by the rapid stream.</p>

<p>Things were in this state when the two sisters
reached home, one day, from town. When
Maud felt how the bridge jarred, she ran back
screaming, and told Daisy to go first, and make
sure it was safe.</p>

<p>Daisy was not a coward; but this time she
did think of her own life for once, or rather
of Joseph&mdash;how he would grieve if she were
swept away and drowned.</p>

<p>Her heart beat faster than usual; yet she
walked on calmly, and soon gained the other
side. Then she called back for Maud to wait
till she could find Joseph, and secure his help.</p>

<p>But Maud, always impatient, grew tired of
waiting, and mustering all her courage, stepped
upon the bridge alone.</p>

<p>She had hardly reached the centre when its
foundations gave way; and, with a great crash
and whirl, with the trees, and ice, and drift<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
wood whirling after it, the bridge went sweeping
down the stream.</p>

<p>So Joseph and Daisy returned only in time
to hear Maud's shrieks, which sounded louder
than the heavy, jolting logs, and creaking
beams, and grinding ice.</p>

<p>Running across the bridge wildly, she beckoned
for Joseph to come to her&mdash;implored
him to trust himself upon the blocks of ice, or
else send Daisy, and not leave her to perish alone.</p>

<p>There came new drifts of ice from above, jolting
against the bridge, and throwing Maud
from her feet; and so the heavy structure went
whirling, tossing like a straw upon the stream.</p>

<p>Joseph turned to Daisy. "If I go to her
help, we both may slip from the unsteady blocks
of ice, and drown. Yet I may possibly save
her; shall I go or stay?"</p>

<p>"Go," she said instantly.</p>

<p>"Then good by, Daisy; perhaps we never
shall look in each other's faces again."</p>

<p>"Not here, perhaps; but, go."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's that?" asked the sharp voice of the
dame. "Foolish children! Don't you know
that, when Maud is drowned, there will be no
one to separate you, and, as long as she lives,
she will not let you be married?"</p>

<p>"She is my sister," said Daisy. And Joseph,
stepping boldly upon the ice, creeping from log
to log,&mdash;lost now in the branches of a tree,
dashed into the water, and struggling out again,&mdash;found
his way to the bridge, and threw his
strong arm about the form of the fainting Maud.</p>

<p>But here was new trouble; for she declared
that she would never venture where Joseph had
been, not if they both were swept away.</p>

<p>Finding her so unreasonable, the herdsman
took Maud, like an infant, in his arms, and,
though she shrieked and struggled, stepped from
the bridge just as its straining beams parted,
and fell, one by one, among the drift wood
in the stream.</p>

<p>When Maud stood safely on the shore, she
was so glad to find herself alive, that she took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
off every one of her jewels and offered them
to Joseph.</p>

<p>But the herdsman told her that he did not
wish to be paid for what had cost him nothing,
and had he lost his life, the jewels would
have been no recompense.</p>

<p>"So you want more, perhaps," said Maud, the
haughty look coming again into her handsome
face. "Well, what shall I give you for risking
your precious life?"</p>

<p>"Daisy," he answered.</p>

<p>"My sister? Do you dare tell me that she
would marry a cowboy?"</p>

<p>"Ask her."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Daisy.</p>

<p>"Nonsense! you will live with me, Daisy, in
my new great house; and if you marry at all,
it will be some rich, elegant man, so that you
can entertain us when I and my husband wish
to visit you."</p>

<p>"I shall marry Joseph or no one," Daisy answered
firmly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, then, Joseph, cross the river on the
ice once more, and Daisy shall be your wife."
Maud thought she had found a way to rid
herself of the troublesome herdsman; for it
seemed to her the dreadful voyage could not
be made again in safety; and then she half
believed that Joseph would sooner give up Daisy
than try.</p>

<p>But, without a word, he darted upon the ice&mdash;slipped,
as at first; and when Daisy saw
him struggling, she flew to his help&mdash;slipped
where he slipped: a tree came sailing down,
and struck them both. Maud saw no more.</p>

<p>But, all the way home, she heard in her ears
the shrill voice of the fairy, saying, "I hope
you are satisfied, now you have killed them
both."</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXV.</h3>
<h4>THE FAIRY'S LAST GIFT.</h4>

<p>Maud went home to the lonely cabin; there
was no one to make a fire, and dry her wet
clothes, and comfort her. When little Susan
heard what had happened, she ran away to live
with the mother of Joseph; and Maud was
left alone.</p>

<p>Wearied with fright, and trouble, and remorse,
the beauty sank upon her bed and fell asleep.</p>

<p>But hardly were her eyes closed, when she
seemed in a damp, cellar-like place herself, but,
looking upward, saw the glorious golden city
Daisy told her about, with its pearly gates and
diamond foundations, and the river shaded by
beautiful palms, and throngs of angels walking
on its banks.</p>

<p>The ranks of angels parted, and she saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
among them the Beautiful One, who had met
her in the wood&mdash;only he was bright and
joyous now, and his wounds shone like stars;
and&mdash;could it be? yes&mdash;he was leading Daisy
and Joseph, not a poor drudge and humble
herdsboy now, but, like the other angels, clothed
in light, crowned with lilies, and Joseph's harp
of reeds changed to a golden harp, on which
he still made music.</p>

<p>She saw two other beautiful ones come forward
and embrace her sister: one, she felt,
was the father she had never seen, and one
was Susan, the good and humble mother of
whom Maud had been ashamed.</p>

<p>Then she awoke, to find herself alone in the
cabin, which was damp and dark as she had
dreamed; and she could only hear the night
wind sighing, and the voices of the wolves and
snakes.</p>

<p>As soon as morning came, she hurried to
the river bank, in hopes, thus late, to save her
sister, or to hear, at least, some news from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
her. But she saw only floating logs and blocks
of ice jarring and whirling down the river.</p>

<p>And from that hour Maud believed herself
a murderer, and would gladly have given her
own life to forget the dreadful scene, which
kept rising before her, of the good, gentle
sister drowning in the flood, and the sound of
the dame's shrill voice asking, "Now, are you
satisfied?"</p>

<p>But Daisy did not drown. When Joseph
saw her danger, though almost dead himself, he
took fresh courage, and made such bold, brave
efforts that both he and Daisy reached the shore.</p>

<p>Long, happy days they spent together on
the earth. Determined that she should have
no more trouble with her sister, Joseph took
his wife over the sea to a pleasant island,
where she had a happier, if not so splendid
a home as Maud.</p>

<p>When he opened the door to show Daisy
her beautiful little house, who should stand
within but the fairy, all dressed in her velvet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
and pearls, and looking as bright as if she
too were glad that Daisy's life was to be so
happy now.</p>

<p>Many a gift the fairy brought them: little
Peters, and Susans, and Daisies came in her
arms, to play before their door, and make the
cottage merry with their songs, before <i>our</i> Daisy
went to wear her crown in heaven. And many
a pleasant tune Joseph played to his wife and
children on the home-made harp of reeds, before
it was changed to a harp of gold, and
chimed in with the angels' music, in our
Father's home above.</p>

<p>When packing her things, to leave the cabin,
Maud left Daisy's dresses, as they were not
fine enough for her, and also some little things
which her sister had treasured&mdash;among them,
the spectacles.</p>

<p>But once in her fine new home, and the
wedding over, the first things she found, hanging
in the fringe of her shawl, were Daisy's
spectacles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>So she thought how queerly Daisy used to
look in them, and put the glasses on, to amuse
her husband; but what was her surprise to find
she could see plainly through them now!</p>

<p>And, alas! the first thing they told her was,
that this man, for whom she had left all her
rich suitors, did not love her, but her money;
despised her because her mother was so poor,
and was much fonder of one of the ladies whom
he had forsaken than of her.</p>

<p>She told him this angrily; but he only
laughed, and said she might have guessed it
without spectacles, and asked how he could
love any one who thought only of herself.</p>

<p>She hoped he might be jesting, yet his words
were soon proved true; for he not only neglected,
but treated her harshly, and when she
was saddest, dragged her to the balls which
she no longer enjoyed, and laughed about her
spectacles, which began to leave their mark
upon her handsome face.</p>

<p>"At least," thought Maud, "I am very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
rich; there is no end to my jewelry. I
will find out all its value through the spectacles."</p>

<p>But though there were pearls and diamonds,
emeralds, rubies, and sapphires, set in heavy
gold, they seemed only a handful through the
glasses; while she saw whole heaps of finer
pearls lying neglected under the sea, and rubies,
and emeralds, and diamonds scattered about
on the sands, or in the heart of rocks, enough
to build a house. Melted along the veins of the
earth she discovered so much gold, too, that
her own didn't seem worth keeping; for Maud
only valued things when she thought others
could not have so fine.</p>

<p>Do you remember what the dame said, when
she placed the spectacles on little Daisy's breast?
"Take care of her heart, now, Peter, and this
gift of mine will be a precious one."</p>

<p>Here was the trouble: Maud, with all her
beauty and wealth, had not taken care of her
heart; and so, when Daisy saw bright, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
wise, and pleasant things through the glasses,
Maud saw only sad and painful ones.</p>

<p>The beauty grew tired of life; her husband
was so jealous that he would not allow any
one to admire her; and she found the palace
did not make her any happier than the cabin
had done, nor did the open country seem any
brighter than the wood.</p>

<p>For it isn't whether we <i>live</i> in a palace or
a cave, but whether our hearts are cheerful
palaces or gloomy caves, that makes the difference
between sad lives and merry ones.</p>

<p>So, one day, when the dame appeared with
her gifts, Maud said, "O, take them away&mdash;take
back all the beauty, the power, and money
you ever brought, and give me a heart like
Daisy's."</p>

<p>"Pretty likely," said the dame. "You asked
for money&mdash;you and your mother, both; now
make the most of it."</p>

<p>But the old woman had hardly left the house
when one of Maud's servants brought her in,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
wounded, and weeping bitterly, for a wagon
had run over her.</p>

<p>"Carry her home to her cave; why did you
bring her to me?" said Maud.</p>

<p>But just then she seemed to see the cold,
bare cave that Daisy had told her about, with
nothing except wooden stools and a smoky fireplace&mdash;no
soft bed, no child to watch over
and comfort the poor old dame.</p>

<p>So Maud called the servants back, and had
the woman placed in her own room, and watched
with her, and bathed her limbs, and though she
was fretful, did not once neglect her through
a long and tedious illness.</p>

<p>At last, the dame felt well enough to go
home, and bade good by to Maud, who begged
her not to go; "for," she said,&mdash;and the
tears came into her eyes,&mdash;"you make me
think of dear Daisy, the only one that ever
loved me, with this selfish heart."</p>

<p>"No, no; I cannot trust you," said the dame,
and disappeared.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>But she came back, with such a bundle in
her arms as she had brought to Susan once;
and when Maud looked up to thank her, lo!
the dame had changed to a lovely fairy, with
a young, sweet face&mdash;the same that Daisy
used to talk about.</p>

<p>Bending over Maud, she wiped the tears from
her face, and put the bundle in her arms, and
disappeared.</p>

<p>And when the little child learned to love
her, Maud forgot her fears and cares, her cruel
husband and her selfish self, and found how
much happier it makes us to give joy than to
receive it.</p>

<p>The little girl was named Daisy, and grew
up not only beautiful and rich, but wise and
good; she spent her money nobly, and gained
the love and added to the happiness of all
her friends.</p>

<p>But the one whom she made happiest was
her own mother&mdash;Maud.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXVI.</h3>
<h4>WHAT IT ALL MEANS.</h4>

<p>Now, dear children, I suppose you have guessed
all my riddles, for they are not hard ones; but
I will tell you the meaning of one or two.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Life</span> is the old fairy, that comes sometimes
frowning and wretched, sometimes smiling and
lovely, but always benevolent, always taking
better care of us than we take of ourselves.</p>

<p>We should be silent, helpless dust, except for
Life; and whether we be great or humble, rich
or poor, she gives us all we have.</p>

<p>Though she may seem to smile on you and
frown upon your sister, be sure it is not because
she loves you best; the fairy may yet
change into a wrinkled dame, or the dame to
a beautiful fairy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>When you remember her, beware how you
grieve or slight any one. If you are passing
some poor beggar in the street, think, "Had I
on Daisy's spectacles, I should see under all
these rags a child of the great God, travelling
on, as I am travelling, to live with him in the
golden city above. While this man seems
humble to me, angels may bow to him as they
pass invisibly; for all the titles in this world
are not so great as to be a child of God."</p>

<p>When you are tempted to vex or laugh at
some old woman, think, "Under these wrinkles,
lo! the great fairy, Life, is hid; and she can
curse or bless me, as I will."</p>

<p>The old dame's lantern, and the light in
his breast by which Joseph saw, were Instinct;
which, if we could but keep it undimmed by
the dust of earth, would always light our
pathway.</p>

<p>And the fairy bread is Kindness, which alone
can comfort the poor and sorrowful. They
may use what we give in charity, and still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
be poor and sad; but an act of kindness
makes them feel that they too are children of
the same great God, and are therefore happy
and rich, though they must walk about for a
little while in rags.</p>

<p>For they remember how, like us, they have
a glorious home awaiting them in the city
whose streets are gold; and then it doesn't
seem so hard that they have less than we of
the poor gold of earth.</p>

<p>The spectacles are Wisdom, which shows us
all things as they are, not as they seem&mdash;which
we may learn, like Daisy, from insects, trees,
and clouds, or, easier still, from words that the
wise have written.</p>

<p>Believe me, this wisdom, which may seem but
a tedious thing, will show any of you as wonderful
visions as those I have told you about.</p>

<p>So, when your lessons are hard, and you long
to play, and wonder what's the use in books,
think, "They are Daisy's wondrous spectacles,
that change our dull earth into fairy land."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>Wearing these, you need never be lonely or
afraid, but will feel God's strong and loving
arm around you in the dreariest place. The
sun will seem his watchful eye, the wind his
breath, the flowers his messages. You will
know that all good and lovely things are gifts
from him.</p>

<p>And you will not forget that the fairy, Life,
is still on earth, and, if we ask her, will lead
us all to the wonderful city which Daisy saw
far up above the pines&mdash;where you, too, may
be good and peaceful, like the rest, and wear
a crown of lilies and a robe of light.</p>

<p>"Woodworth is unquestionably and immeasurably the best writer for
children that we know of; for he combines a sturdy common sense and
varied information with a most childlike and loveful spirit, that finds its
way at once to the child's heart. We regard him as one of the truest benefactors
of his race; for he is as wise as he is gentle, and never uses his
power over the child-heart to instil into it the poison of false teaching, or
to cramp it with unlovely bigotry. The publishers have done their part, as
well as the author, to make these volumes attractive. Altogether we regard
them as one of the pleasantest series of juvenile books extant, both in their
literary character and mechanical execution."&mdash;<i>Syracuse (N. Y.) Daily

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
